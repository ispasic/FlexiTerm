Cell-specific differences in <a href="output.html#6">activation of NF-kappa B</a> <a href="output.html#58">regulatory elements</a> of <a href="output.html#18">human immunodeficiency virus</a> and beta interferon promoters by <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a>.

Three aspects of the involvement of <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a> in <a href="output.html#18">human immunodeficiency virus</a> (<a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>) pathogenesis were examined.
<a href="output.html#1">Tumor necrosis factor alpha</a> (<a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>) mRNA production was analyzed by <a href="output.html#128">polymerase chain reaction</a> amplification in monocytic <a href="output.html#106">U937 cells</a> and in a chronically <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a> infected U937 <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> (U9-IIIB).
<a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> RNA was undetectable in <a href="output.html#106">U937 cells</a>, whereas a low constitutive level was detected in U9-IIIB cells.
Paramyxovirus infection induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the steady-state level of <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> RNA in U9-IIIB cells compared with <a href="output.html#106">U937 cells</a>, suggesting that <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-infected <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a> produced higher levels of <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> than did <a href="output.html#199">normal cells</a> after a secondary virus infection.
The effects of <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> on <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> were examined by <a href="output.html#141">transient expression</a> assays using reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids linked to <a href="output.html#58">regulatory elements</a> from the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a> long terminal repeat (LTR) and the <a href="output.html#173">beta interferon promoter</a>.
In U937 and Jurkat T lymphoid cells, the inducibility of the different hybrid promoters by <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> or <a href="output.html#147">phorbol ester</a> varied in a <a href="output.html#148">cell type</a>- and promoter context-specific manner; the levels of <a href="output.html#90">gene activity</a> of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>-containing plasmids correlated directly with induction of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a>.
Although the intact <a href="output.html#173">beta interferon promoter</a> was only weakly stimulated by <a href="output.html#147">phorbol ester</a> or <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>, multimers of the PRDII <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>-binding domain were inducible by both agents.
<a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> was able to increase expression of the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a> LTR in T cells, but in <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a>, <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> did not induce the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a> LTR above a constitutive level of activity.
This level of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>-independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication, since <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> treatment had no effect on the kinetics of de novo <a href="output.html#98">HIV type</a> 1 (<a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1) infection and viral RNA production in <a href="output.html#106">U937 cells</a>.
However, in <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a>, <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> dramatically enhanced the spread of <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 through the <a href="output.html#244">cell population</a> and increased viral RNA synthesis, indicating that in T cells <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 multiplication was stimulated by <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> treatment.

<a href="output.html#7">Glucocorticoid receptors</a> on <a href="output.html#245">mononuclear leukocytes</a> in <a href="output.html#149">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

Several lines of evidence suggest disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system in <a href="output.html#149">Alzheimer's disease</a> (<a href="output.html#149">AD</a>).
In an exploration of the potential role of the <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptor</a> (<a href="output.html#7">GR</a>) in <a href="output.html#149">AD</a>, <a href="output.html#7">GR</a> density and affinity were assessed on <a href="output.html#245">mononuclear leukocytes</a> of 12 <a href="output.html#149">AD</a> patients and 12 healthy controls.
<a href="output.html#7">GR</a> binding characteristics did not differ between patients and controls or between patients subdivided according to diagnosis or associated clinical features.
These data suggest that the abnormalities of the HPA system in <a href="output.html#149">AD</a> are not related to a <a href="output.html#7">GR</a> deficiency.

Purification of <a href="output.html#145">TCF-1 alpha</a>, a T-cell-specific <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> that activates the T-<a href="output.html#109">cell receptor</a> C alpha gene enhancer in a context-dependent manner.

The <a href="output.html#92">differentiation of T cells</a> into functionally diverse subpopulations is controlled in part, by <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activation</a> and silencing; however, little is known in detail about the proteins that influence this developmental process.
We have purified a new T-cell-specific factor, <a href="output.html#145">TCF-1 alpha</a>, that is implicated in the <a href="output.html#90">activation of genes</a> encoding a major component of the human T-<a href="output.html#109">cell receptor</a> (TCR).
<a href="output.html#145">TCF-1 alpha</a>, originally identified and purified through its <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a> on the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 promoter, was found to bind to the <a href="output.html#127">TCR alpha enhancer</a> and to promoters for several genes expressed at significantly earlier stages of T-<a href="output.html#241">cell development</a> than the TCR alpha gene (e.g., p56lck and CD3 delta).
Sequences related to the <a href="output.html#145">TCF-1 alpha</a> binding motif (5'-GGCACCCTTTGA-3') are also found in the human TCR delta (and possibly TCR beta) enhancers.
Southwestern and gel renaturation experiments with the use of purified protein fractions revealed that <a href="output.html#145">TCF-1 alpha</a> activity is derived from a family of 57- to 53-kD proteins that are abundantly expressed in mature and immature <a href="output.html#78">T-cell lines</a> (Jurkat, CCRF-CEM) and not in mature <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> (JY, Namalwa) or nonlymphoid (HeLa) <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a>.
A small 95-bp fragment of the TCR alpha control region that contains the <a href="output.html#91">TCF-1 alpha binding site</a> juxtaposed between a cAMP-<a href="output.html#64">response element</a> (the CRE or T alpha 1 motif) and the <a href="output.html#40">binding site</a> for a distinct lymphoid-specific protein (TCF-2 alpha) behaved as a potent T-cell-specific enhancer in vivo.
Tandem copies of this enhancer functioned synergistically in mature (Jurkat) <a href="output.html#78">T-cell lines</a> as well as resting and activated immature (CCRF-CEM) <a href="output.html#78">T-cell lines</a>.
Mutation of the <a href="output.html#91">TCF-1 alpha binding site</a> diminished <a href="output.html#150">enhancer activity</a> and disrupted the synergism observed in vivo between tandem enhancer repeats.
The <a href="output.html#91">TCF-1 alpha binding site</a> was also required for <a href="output.html#127">TCR alpha enhancer</a> activity in transcriptionally active extracts from Jurkat but not <a href="output.html#246">HeLa cells</a>, confirming that <a href="output.html#145">TCF-1 alpha</a> is a T-cell-specific <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>.
Curiously, the <a href="output.html#145">TCF-1 alpha</a> binding element was inactive in vivo when removed from its neighboring elements on the <a href="output.html#127">TCR alpha enhancer</a> and positioned in one or more copies upstream of a heterologous promoter.
Thus, the <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activity</a> of <a href="output.html#145">TCF-1 alpha</a> appears to depend on the TCF-2 alpha and T alpha 1 (CREB) <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> and the context of its <a href="output.html#40">binding site</a> within the <a href="output.html#127">TCR alpha enhancer</a>.

Inhibition of <a href="output.html#142">HIV-1 replication</a> and <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappa B activity</a> by cysteine and cysteine derivatives.

<a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 proviral DNA contains two <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a> for the <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>.
<a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1-infected individuals have, on average, abnormally high levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (<a href="output.html#1">TNF alpha</a>) and abnormally low plasma cysteine levels.
We therefore investigated the effects of cysteine and related thiols on <a href="output.html#142">HIV-1 replication</a> and <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> expression.
The experiments in this report show that cysteine or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) raise the intracellular glutathione (GSH) level and inhibit <a href="output.html#142">HIV-1 replication</a> in persistently infected Molt-4 and <a href="output.html#106">U937 cells</a>.
However, inhibition of <a href="output.html#142">HIV-1 replication</a> appears not to be directly correlated with GSH levels.
Cysteine and NAC also inhibit <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappa B activity</a> as determined by <a href="output.html#14">electrophoretic mobility shift assays</a> and <a href="output.html#81">chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase</a> (<a href="output.html#81">CAT</a>) <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> under control of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a> in uninfected cells.
This suggests that the cysteine deficiency in <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1-infected individuals may cause an over-expression of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>-dependent genes and enhance <a href="output.html#142">HIV-1 replication</a>.
NAC may be considered for the treatment of <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1-infected individuals.

Regulation of <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptors</a> in <a href="output.html#174">human mononuclear cells</a>: effects of glucocorticoid treatment, <a href="output.html#107">Cushing's disease</a> and ketoconazole.

<a href="output.html#7">Glucocorticoid receptors</a> (<a href="output.html#7">GcR</a>) were determined by a whole cell assay in human mononulear leukocytes (hMNL) from control subjects, patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for systemic diseases and <a href="output.html#107">Cushing's disease</a> patients with or without ketoconazole therapy.
Prolonged corticosteroid treatment resulted in down-regulation of <a href="output.html#7">GcR</a>, while the mean level of <a href="output.html#7">GcR</a> in <a href="output.html#107">Cushing's disease</a> was normal.
In this group, however, receptor levels and morning plasma cortisol values showed a negative correlation, indicating a subtle down-regulatory effect.
Furthermore, <a href="output.html#7">GcR</a> were unaltered after these patients received ketoconazole, in spite of a marked reduction in morning plasma cortisol and urinary free cortisol.
We also observed that ketoconazole was a weak competitor of <a href="output.html#7">GcR</a> in intact cells, although it significantly inhibited [3H] dexamethasone binding in cytosolic preparations from rat tissues.
The results suggested that <a href="output.html#7">GcR</a> in hMNL are down-regulated by synthetic steroids given in vivo, but they showed very mild down-regulation in hypercortisolemic patients suffering from <a href="output.html#107">Cushing's disease</a>.
Finally, we did not observed either up-regulation or antagonism of <a href="output.html#7">GcR</a> by ketoconazole treatment, at the time that cortisol levels of patients with <a href="output.html#107">Cushing's disease</a> were reduced.
This indicates that the beneficial effects of ketoconazole in <a href="output.html#107">Cushing's disease</a> are due to adrenal cortisol suppression and not to interaction with <a href="output.html#7">GcR</a> of target cells, and that the process of <a href="output.html#7">GcR</a> regulation in hMNL is a complex phenomenon awaiting further elucidation.

Negative regulation of <a href="output.html#98">human immunodeficiency virus type</a> 1 expression in monocytes: role of the 65-kDa plus <a href="output.html#180">50-kDa NF-kappa B</a> dimer.

Although <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a> can provide a reservoir for <a href="output.html#200">viral production</a> in vivo, their regulation of <a href="output.html#98">human immunodeficiency virus type</a> 1 (<a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1) transcription can be either latent, restricted, or productive.
These differences in <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> have not been molecularly defined.
In <a href="output.html#111">THP-1 cells</a> with restricted <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a> expression, there is an absence of DNA-protein binding complex formation with the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 promoter-enhancer associated with markedly less viral RNA production.
This absence of binding was localized to the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> region of the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 enhancer; the 65-kDa plus <a href="output.html#180">50-kDa NF-kappa B</a> heterodimer was preferentially lost.
Adding purified <a href="output.html#74">NF-kappa B protein</a> to <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> from cells with restricted expression overcomes this lack of binding.
In addition, treatment of these <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> with sodium deoxycholate restored their ability to form the heterodimer, suggesting the presence of an inhibitor of <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappa B activity</a>.
Furthermore, treatment of <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> from these cells that had restricted expression with lipopolysaccharide increased <a href="output.html#200">viral production</a> and <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappa B activity</a>.
Antiserum specific for <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> <a href="output.html#168">binding proteins</a>, but not c-rel-specific antiserum, disrupted <a href="output.html#296">heterodimer complex formation</a>.
Thus, both <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>-binding complexes are needed for optimal viral transcription.
Binding of the 65-kDa plus 50-kDa heterodimer to the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 enhancer can be negatively regulated in monocytes, providing one mechanism restricting <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a>.

A novel primer extension method to detect the number of CAG repeats in the <a href="output.html#175">androgen receptor gene</a> in families with X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.

X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), an adult-onset form of motor neuron disease, was recently reported to be caused by amplification of the CAG repeats in the <a href="output.html#175">androgen receptor gene</a>.
We report here a simple and rapid strategy to detect the precise number of the CAGs.
After the DNA fragment containing the CAG repeats is amplified by the <a href="output.html#128">polymerase chain reaction</a>, a primer extension is carried out; the extension of the end-labelled reverse primer adjacent to 3' end of CAG repeats stops at the first T after CAG repeats with the incorporation of dideoxy ATP in the reaction mixture.
The resultant primer products are analysed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.
This method could be quite useful to detect not only CAG repeats in SBMA but also other polymorphic dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats.

Activity of the <a href="output.html#84">kappa B enhancer</a> of the interleukin-2 <a href="output.html#201">receptor alpha chain</a> in somatic cell hybrids is accompanied by the nuclear localization of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>.

The two <a href="output.html#117">nuclear proteins</a> <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> (consisting of subunits p50 an dp65) and the <a href="output.html#258">DNA-binding subunit</a> of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> (p50) by itself, also called KBF1, are constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus of the human <a href="output.html#78">T-cell line</a> IARC 301.5.
In order to define the roles of these two factors, which bind to the same <a href="output.html#84">kappa B enhancers</a>, in <a href="output.html#11">transcription activation</a> we have prepared somatic cell hybrids between IARC 301.5 and a murine myeloma.
Most hybrids express both KBF1 and <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> in their nuclei, but one hybrid expresses only KBF1.
The <a href="output.html#84">kappa B enhancer</a> of the gene encoding the interleukin-2 (IL-2) <a href="output.html#201">receptor alpha chain</a> (<a href="output.html#94">IL-2R</a> alpha) is functional only in the hybrids expressing <a href="output.html#73">nuclear NF-kappa B</a>.
These findings show that <a href="output.html#73">nuclear NF-kappa B</a> is necessary to activate the <a href="output.html#84">kappa B enhancer</a>, while KBF1 by itself is not sufficient.
We propose that KBF1 is a competitive inhibitor of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> and discuss how these factors may be involved in the <a href="output.html#141">transient expression</a> of IL-2 and IL-2 alpha genes during the <a href="output.html#151">immune response</a>.

Kinetics of <a href="output.html#108">nuclear translocation</a> and turnover of the vitamin D receptor in human HL60 leukemia cells and <a href="output.html#45">peripheral blood lymphocytes</a>--coincident rise of DNA-relaxing activity in <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a>.

High affinity receptors (VDR) for 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) are expressed in HL60 human leukemia cells and in low numbers in <a href="output.html#45">peripheral blood lymphocytes</a> (<a href="output.html#45">PBL</a>).
<a href="output.html#248">HL60 cells</a>, expressing some characteristics of promyelocytes, can be induced to monocytoid differentiation by calcitriol.
Specific <a href="output.html#108">nuclear translocation</a> of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was examined after exposure of whole cells to 10(-9) M/l calcitriol in the presence and absence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled ligand and subsequent isolation of nuclei.
Specific <a href="output.html#108">nuclear translocation</a> of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was found to be time dependent reaching a maximum of approximately 2100 <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a>/nucleus after 3 h of incubation in <a href="output.html#248">HL60 cells</a>, whereas a maximum of approximately 310 <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a>/nucleus was found after 3 h in <a href="output.html#45">PBL</a>.
Pulse exposure of HL60 to radiolabeled hormone for 3 h followed by culture in medium without serum and calcitriol lead to nuclear retention of approximately 1600 radiolabeled VDR by 8 h and approximately 1000 VDR by 24 h.
Radiolabeled VDR disappeared from the <a href="output.html#152">nuclear compartment</a> with a halflife of approximately 30 min if cells were cultured with identical concentrations of unlabeled hormone after the pulse (pulse/chase-experiments).
No difference of VDR retention in pulse and pulse/chase-experiments was seen in <a href="output.html#45">PBL</a>, where VDR halflife was approximately 30 min.
No specific translocation into the <a href="output.html#152">nuclear compartment</a> was seen when isolated nuclei were incubated in [3H]calcitriol.
Radiolabeled hormone/receptor complexes of nuclei isolated from cells exposed for 3 h to radiolabeled hormone--in contrast to identical experiments with intact cells--did not disappear from the <a href="output.html#152">nuclear compartment</a> upon incubation of nuclei with identical concentrations of the unlabeled compound.
The <a href="output.html#202">activity of DNA</a> relaxing enzymes (e.g. topoisomerases I and II) in <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> was measured using a PBR 322-relaxation-assay.
Enhanced overall enzyme activity was found in <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> by 1 h after incubation with calcitriol (final ethanol concentration 0.0001% v/v) in HL60 and <a href="output.html#45">PBL</a>.
The <a href="output.html#150">enhanced activity</a> disappeared after 2 h in <a href="output.html#45">PBL</a>, whereas it was still enhanced by 4 h in HL60.
No effect was seen in ethanol treated controls.
We conclude that a specific <a href="output.html#108">nuclear translocation</a> mechanism exists for calcitriol in both <a href="output.html#148">cell types</a> examined, most likely due to translocation of receptor proteins after hormone binding.
Translocated hormone/receptor complexes compete for a limited number of specific nuclear <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a>.
<a href="output.html#150">Enhanced activity</a> of topoisomerases in <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> upon translocation of VDR might reflect interaction of both within the <a href="output.html#152">nuclear compartment</a>, thus initiating DNA-unwinding, a prerequisite of transcription initiation.

[Age-related changes in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of healthy persons and <a href="output.html#249">patients with hypertension</a>]

It has been found that the number of <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptors</a> in lymphocytes of the <a href="output.html#19">peripheral blood</a> of healthy elderly subjects increases, while the number of mineralocorticoid receptors decreases.
The mechanisms of hormone-receptor interactions in hypertension are activated: the number of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a> grows in <a href="output.html#249">hypertensive patients</a>.
Still a more essential rise in the number of receptors is observed in mid-age <a href="output.html#249">hypertensive patients</a> than in elderly ones.

Characterization of a new tissue-specific <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> binding to the simian virus 40 enhancer TC-II (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>) element.

This factor has a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> but is unrelated to this or other <a href="output.html#153">Rel proteins</a> by functional and biochemical criteria.
It can also be distinguished from other previously described lymphocyte-specific DNA-<a href="output.html#168">binding proteins</a>.

Expression of PILOT, a putative <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>, requires two signals and is cyclosporin A sensitive in T cells.

Few known genes (IL-2, members of the IL-8 family, interferon-gamma) are induced in T cells only through the combined effect of phorbol myristic acetate (<a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>) and a Ca(2+)-ionophore, and expression of only these genes can be fully suppressed by Cyclosporin A (CyA).
We have identified a putative <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>, designated PILOT, with an identical dual signal requirement for expression.
Induction of the PILOT gene is detectable in <a href="output.html#9">human T cells</a> 20 min following activation in the presence of cycloheximide and is fully suppressed by CyA.
The PILOT protein has a calculated M(r) of 42.6 kDa and contains three <a href="output.html#239">zinc fingers</a> of the C2H2-type at the carboxyl-terminus which are highly homologous to the zinc finger regions of the <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> EGR1, EGR2, and pAT 133.
In contrast to T cells, in fibroblasts PILOT <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> requires only one signal (<a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>) and is not affected by CyA.
This observation directly demonstrates the existence of a Ca2+ signal-dependent <a href="output.html#58">regulatory element</a> obligatory for expression of some <a href="output.html#103">genes in T cells</a> but not in fibroblasts.
This differential expression model will be valuable in the dissection of the dual signal pathway in T cells and the effects of CyA upon it.

<a href="output.html#11">Transcriptional activation</a> of human zeta 2 <a href="output.html#93">globin promoter</a> by the alpha globin <a href="output.html#58">regulatory element</a> (HS-40): functional role of specific <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a>-DNA complexes.

We studied the functional interaction between human embryonic zeta 2 <a href="output.html#93">globin promoter</a> and the alpha globin <a href="output.html#58">regulatory element</a> (HS-40) located 40 kb upstream of the zeta 2 <a href="output.html#203">globin gene</a>.
It was shown by <a href="output.html#141">transient expression</a> assay that HS-40 behaved as an authentic enhancer for high-level zeta 2 <a href="output.html#93">globin promoter</a> activity in <a href="output.html#250">K562 cells</a>, an erythroid <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> of embryonic and/or fetal origin.
Although sequences located between -559 and -88 of the zeta 2 <a href="output.html#203">globin gene</a> were dispensable for its expression on enhancerless plasmids, they were required for the HS-40 enhancer-mediated activity of the zeta 2 <a href="output.html#93">globin promoter</a>.
<a href="output.html#204">Site-directed mutagenesis</a> demonstrated that this HS-40 enhancer-zeta 2 <a href="output.html#93">globin promoter</a> interaction is mediated by the two GATA-1 factor binding motifs located at -230 and -104, respectively.
The functional domains of HS-40 were also mapped.
Bal 31 deletion mapping data suggested that one GATA-1 motif, one GT motif, and two NF-E2/<a href="output.html#24">AP</a>1 motifs together formed the functional core of HS-40 in the erythroid-specific activation of the zeta 2 <a href="output.html#93">globin promoter</a>.
<a href="output.html#204">Site-directed mutagenesis</a> further demonstrated that the enhancer function of one of the two NF-E2/<a href="output.html#24">AP</a>1 motifs of HS-40 is mediated through its binding to NF-E2 but not <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>1 <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>.
Finally, we did genomic footprinting of the HS-40 enhancer region in <a href="output.html#250">K562 cells</a>, adult nucleated erythroblasts, and different <a href="output.html#154">nonerythroid cells</a>.
All sequence motifs within the functional core of HS-40, as mapped by <a href="output.html#141">transient expression</a> analysis, appeared to bind a <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a>(s) in living <a href="output.html#250">K562 cells</a> but not in <a href="output.html#154">nonerythroid cells</a>.
On the other hand, only one of the apparently nonfunctional sequence motifs was bound with factors in vivo.
In comparison to K562, nucleated erythroblasts from adult human bone marrow exhibited a similar but nonidentical pattern of <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> binding in vivo at the HS-40 region.
These data suggest that <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activation</a> of human embryonic zeta 2 <a href="output.html#203">globin gene</a> and the fetal/adult alpha globin genes is mediated by erythroid cell-specific and developmental stage-specific <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a>-DNA complexes which form at the enhancer (HS-40) and the <a href="output.html#93">globin promoters</a>.

Costimulation of cAMP and <a href="output.html#20">protein kinase C</a> pathways inhibits the CD3-dependent T <a href="output.html#29">cell activation</a> and leads to a persistent expression of the <a href="output.html#176">AP-1 transcription factor</a>.

The effects mediated by a combined stimulation of cAMP -and <a href="output.html#20">protein kinase C</a> (<a href="output.html#20">PKC</a>)-dependent pathways have been investigated in different cellular systems, and it has been shown that they may complement each other in activating <a href="output.html#251">cell proliferation</a> and differentiation.
In this report, we show that upon the stimulation of both pathways T lymphocytes became refractory to activation via the CD3/T <a href="output.html#109">cell receptor</a> (TcR) complex.
T cells preincubated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (<a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>) and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) displayed a deficient proliferative ability in response to anti-CD3 mAb stimulation, whereas lymphocytes treated individually with either Bt2cAMP or <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a> responded comparably to untreated samples.
We detected an association between the reduced mitogenic response and low expression of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the alpha chain (CD25) of the <a href="output.html#94">IL-2 receptor</a> (<a href="output.html#94">IL-2R</a>).
Analysis of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization suggested that the CD3/TcR-dependent <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> was impaired in <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>/Bt2cAMP-treated cells.
Remarkably, we observed that these samples displayed a persistent expression of the c-fos protooncogene, associated to an increased <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a>, whereas no variations of CREB or NF-kB were detected.
Neither Bt2cAMP nor <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a> individually mediated these sustained effects, which therefore appear as a consequence of the interplay between both metabolic stimuli.
Altogether, the data provide the evidence that both pathways complement each other in regulating <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> and, conversely, downregulate the TcR transduction mechanisms.

Induction of <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> and <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a> by vanadate peroxide, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases.

Rapid <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of key cellular proteins is a crucial event in the transduction of activation signals to T-lymphocytes.
The regulatory role of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) in this process was explored by studying the effects of a powerful PTPase inhibitor, vanadate peroxide (pervanadate), on the activation cascade of Jurkat human leukaemic T-cells.
Pervanadate induced activation of the tyrosine kinases lck and fyn (4- and 3-fold respectively) and a dramatic increase in <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of cellular proteins, notably <a href="output.html#177">phospholipase C gamma</a> 1.
After this event, we observed a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, corresponding to an influx.
This effect required <a href="output.html#110">surface expression</a> of the CD45 PTPase and was not observed in CD45-deficient variants of <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a>.
In the CD45-negative variant, the effect of pervanadate on <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> was globally decreased and some phosphorylated substrates were specifically missing.
Pervanadate also stimulated transcription of the c-fos gene and accumulation of its mRNA as well as several other hallmarks of T-<a href="output.html#163">lymphocyte activation</a> such as <a href="output.html#110">surface expression</a> of the CD69 antigen and the interleukin 2 <a href="output.html#201">receptor alpha-chain</a> (CD25).
Pervanadate synergized with signals delivered by T-cell antigen receptor engagement or by a <a href="output.html#147">phorbol ester</a> to induce interleukin 2 production.
Pervanadate activated <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>, as shown by an increase in <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a> of this <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>.
We thus conclude that PTPases play a crucial role in the negative regulation of <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> culminating in T-<a href="output.html#163">lymphocyte activation</a>.
Moreover, induction of <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> appears sufficient per se to initiate a complete activation programme.

Activation of a novel serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates c-Fos upon stimulation of T and <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a> via antigen and cytokine receptors.

Ligation of Ag receptors in T and <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a> initiates <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> cascades which alter the <a href="output.html#5">expression of genes</a> that regulate <a href="output.html#205">cellular proliferation</a> and differentiation.
The transmission of signals from the membrane to the nucleus is mediated principally through the action of protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases.
We have identified and characterized a novel serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylated the proto-oncogene product, c-Fos, and is termed Fos kinase.
Fos kinase was rapidly activated after ligation of the CD3 and CD2 receptors in Jurkat and normal <a href="output.html#43">human T lymphocytes</a> and in response to IL-6 and anti-IgM in the human B <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a> AF10 and Ramos, respectively.
The <a href="output.html#147">phorbol ester</a>, <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>, was also a potent inducer of Fos kinase activity in all of the above populations, suggesting that <a href="output.html#20">PKC</a> plays a role in the regulation of this enzyme.
Fos kinase phosphorylates c-Fos at a site near the C-terminus, as well as a peptide derived from this region (residues 359-370, RKGSSSNEPSSD), and Fos peptide competitively inhibited c-Fos phosphorylation.
Fos kinase was shown to be distinct from other identified serine/threonine kinases, including <a href="output.html#8">protein kinase</a> A, <a href="output.html#20">protein kinase C</a>, <a href="output.html#65">casein kinase II</a>, MAP kinases, p70S6K and p90RSK.
Fos kinase was purified by anion exchange chromatography and exhibited an apparent M(r) = 65,000 and isoelectric point = 6.1.
Fos kinase may play a role in <a href="output.html#66">transcriptional regulation</a> through its capacity to phosphorylate c-Fos at a site required for expression of the transcriptional transrepressive activity of this molecule.
Moreover, its rapid activation suggests it may have a wider role within <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> cascades in lymphocytes.

Induction of proto-oncogene and cytokine expression in <a href="output.html#155">human peripheral blood monocytes</a> and the monocytic <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> THP-1 after stimulation with mycoplasma-derived material <a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a>.

<a href="output.html#55">Mycoplasma fermentans-derived high-molecular-weight material</a> (<a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a>) was originally described to induce differentiation of murine thymocytes to cytolytic effector T-cells by stimulating IL-6 release from adherent cells.
This study shows that <a href="output.html#155">human peripheral blood monocytes</a> (<a href="output.html#46">PBMo</a>) also respond to <a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a> with increases in <a href="output.html#112">IL-1 beta</a>, IL-6 and <a href="output.html#1">TNF alpha</a> expression, both at the mRNA and protein level.
The induced expression of <a href="output.html#112">IL-1 beta</a> and <a href="output.html#44">TNF alpha mRNA</a> in the <a href="output.html#156">monocytic THP-1 cell line</a> increased as quickly as in <a href="output.html#206">primary cells</a>.
In contrast to <a href="output.html#46">PBMo</a>, THP-1 and 14 other monocytic/myeloid leukemia-derived <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a> did not secrete measurable amounts of the cytokines upon treatment with <a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a>.
<a href="output.html#112">IL-1 beta</a> and IL-6 genes contain <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a> as <a href="output.html#58">regulatory elements</a>, the <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 protein being composed of c-jun and c-fos gene products.
In <a href="output.html#111">THP-1 cells</a> c-jun mRNA expression increased after incubation with <a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a> while positive <a href="output.html#207">c-fos expression</a> remained unaffected.
Although these data suggest <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 regulated cytokine mRNA expression, results from <a href="output.html#46">PBMo</a> are not in accordance with this notion.
In the <a href="output.html#206">primary cells</a> <a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a>-induced elevation of cytokine mRNA levels was preceded by a downregulation of <a href="output.html#207">c-fos expression</a> while positive c-jun expression was not modulated.
c-myc mRNA expression, constitutively high in <a href="output.html#111">THP-1 cells</a>, was induced in <a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a>-stimulated <a href="output.html#46">PBMo</a>.
In conclusion, <a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a>-stimulated induction of cytokine mRNA expression was accompanied by different proto-oncogene responses in <a href="output.html#46">PBMo</a> and <a href="output.html#111">THP-1 cells</a>.
These differences may represent different regulatory pathways of the two cell systems.
Alternatively, these data support the notion that neither <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 nor the c-myc protein are involved in the <a href="output.html#55">MDHM</a>-induced increase in <a href="output.html#112">IL-1 beta</a>, IL-6 or <a href="output.html#44">TNF alpha mRNA</a> levels.
Furthermore, the present results demonstrate clearly that mycoplasma products can have a profound impact on the activation status of eukaryotic cells.

Lipopolysaccharide induction of <a href="output.html#48">tissue factor</a> <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> in <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a> is mediated by binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a <a href="output.html#129">kappa B-like site</a>.

Exposure of <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a> to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>/Rel <a href="output.html#95">family of proteins</a> and leads to the rapid induction of inflammatory gene products, including <a href="output.html#48">tissue factor</a> (<a href="output.html#48">TF</a>).
<a href="output.html#48">TF</a> is the primary cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascades.
Here we report the characterization of a <a href="output.html#157">nuclear complex</a> from <a href="output.html#140">human monocytic cells</a> that bound to a <a href="output.html#129">kappa B-like site</a>, 5'-CGGAGTTTCC-3', in the 5'-flanking region of the human <a href="output.html#130">TF gene</a>.
This <a href="output.html#157">nuclear complex</a> was activated by LPS with kinetics that preceded induction of the <a href="output.html#130">TF gene</a>.
In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the <a href="output.html#131">TF site</a> bound translated c-Rel and p65 homodimers but not p50/p65 heterodimers or <a href="output.html#254">p50 homodimers</a>.
Base-pair substitutions in the <a href="output.html#131">TF site</a> indicated that the presence of a cytosine at position 1 precluded binding of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>.
In fact, under low-ionic-strength conditions, the <a href="output.html#48">TF</a> complex did not migrate with translated p50/p65 dimers but instead comigrated with c-Rel/p65 dimers.
Antibodies against the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> and <a href="output.html#153">Rel proteins</a> and UV cross-linking studies revealed the presence of c-Rel and p65 and the absence of p50 in the <a href="output.html#48">TF</a> complex and further showed that c-Rel/p65 heterodimers selectively bound to the <a href="output.html#48">TF</a> <a href="output.html#129">kappa B-like site</a>.
Functional studies indicated that the <a href="output.html#131">TF site</a> conferred LPS inducibility on a heterologous promoter and was transactivated by c-Rel or p65.
Taken together, our results demonstrated that binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a novel <a href="output.html#129">kappa B-like site</a> mediated LPS induction of <a href="output.html#130">TF gene</a> expression in <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a>.

Role of <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1 Nef expression in activation pathways in CD4+ T cells.

The role of the <a href="output.html#18">human immunodeficiency virus</a> (<a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1) Nef protein in T <a href="output.html#29">cell activation</a> pathways was investigated using a Jurkat CD4+ <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> stably transfected with a Nef expression vector.
Secretion of IL-2 and <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>, <a href="output.html#110">surface expression</a> of IL-2R, and <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a> of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> and <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 (Fos/Jun) <a href="output.html#255">complex in response</a> to <a href="output.html#22">phorbol myristate acetate</a>, <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>, or immobilized antibodies to CD3 were monitored.
These parameters were not modified by Nef expression in <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a>, whereas stimulation with the same stimuli resulted in partial inhibition of <a href="output.html#208">LTR activation</a> in Nef+ <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a>.
This inhibition was not mediated through Nef phosphorylation on Thr-15 or GTP-<a href="output.html#63">binding activity</a> because mutations in critical sites did not alter this inhibition.
Analysis of truncated LTRs confirmed that inhibition of <a href="output.html#208">LTR activation</a> was not mediated through <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>-<a href="output.html#63">binding activity</a> but through the region containing the negative responding elements (NREs).
These results suggest that Nef downmodulates <a href="output.html#208">LTR activation</a> without significantly inhibiting the capacity of T cells to respond to immunological activations.

Distinct DNase-I hypersensitive sites are associated with TAL-1 transcription in erythroid and <a href="output.html#78">T-cell lines</a>.

The tal-1 gene, frequently activated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), is expressed in the erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mast cell lineages during normal hematopoiesis.
To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression, we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a> and in <a href="output.html#78">T-cell lines</a> either with or without tal-1 rearrangements.
Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat, a <a href="output.html#78">T-cell line</a> that expresses tal-1 in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus.
Methylation studies indicated that the tal-15' GC-rich region behaves like a CpG island, hypomethylated in <a href="output.html#199">normal cells</a>, and methylated de novo on transcriptionally inactive alleles in established <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a>.
Five major DNase-I hypersensitive sites (HS) were mapped in the tal-1 locus.
HS I, IV, and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid/megakaryocytic <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a> that express tal-1 from the promoters 1a and 1b.
HS II was weak in hematopoietic <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a>, absent in Hela, and greatly enhanced in Jurkat, suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a>.
HS III was weak in HEL and Jurkat, and greatly enhanced in DU528, a <a href="output.html#78">T-cell line</a> that bears a t (1;14) and initiates tal-1 transcription within exon 4.
These results suggest that distinct <a href="output.html#58">regulatory elements</a> are associated with the use of the different tal-1 promoters.

<a href="output.html#50">Epstein-Barr virus</a> <a href="output.html#256">SM protein</a>.

The protein products of the <a href="output.html#50">Epstein-Barr virus</a> (<a href="output.html#50">EBV</a>) BMLF1 open reading frame have been characterized in the early productive cycle in B95-8 and Akata cells.
The <a href="output.html#256">SM protein</a> derived from the spliced RNA joining BSLF2 to BMLF1 is much the most abundant protein.
SM is a phosphoprotein in <a href="output.html#50">EBV</a>-infected cells and can be phosphorylated in vitro with <a href="output.html#65">casein kinase II</a> (<a href="output.html#65">CKII</a>).
Computer analysis of the <a href="output.html#256">SM protein</a> sequence showed a C terminal section of SM to be related to genome positional homologues of four other herpesviruses and revealed consensus <a href="output.html#65">CKII</a> sites near the N termini of the <a href="output.html#178">EBV SM</a> protein, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) ICP27 protein and the herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) open reading frame 57 protein.
<a href="output.html#204">Site-directed mutagenesis</a> of the consensus <a href="output.html#65">CKII</a> site in <a href="output.html#178">EBV SM</a> greatly reduced the in vitro phosphorylation of SM by <a href="output.html#65">CKII</a>.
The mechanism of transactivation by BMLF1 proteins has been controversial but SM was shown to transactivate <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> from a <a href="output.html#171">CAT reporter</a> construct by increasing the amount of cytoplasmic <a href="output.html#81">CAT</a> mRNA.

Alternate <a href="output.html#121">immune system</a> targets for TCDD: lymphocyte stem cells and extrathymic T-<a href="output.html#241">cell development</a>.

We here summarize evidence that thymic atrophy induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) can be mediated, at least in part, by damage to extrathymic T-cell precursors in bone marrow and fetal liver.
This atrophy induction does not involve apoptotic mechanisms in thymocytes affected by the bcl-2 proto-oncogene.
TCDD mediates atrophy induction through its specific receptor (the AhR) and not through effects on the <a href="output.html#32">estrogen receptor</a>.
Both TCDD and estradiol induce extrathymic T-<a href="output.html#92">cell differentiation</a> in the liver.
These extrathymic T-<a href="output.html#244">cell populations</a> include cells expressing elevated levels of V beta T-cell receptors that are normally deleted in thymic development.

Expression of the Runt domain-encoding <a href="output.html#257">PEBP2 alpha</a> <a href="output.html#103">genes in T cells</a> during thymic development.

The <a href="output.html#257">PEBP2 alpha</a> A and <a href="output.html#257">PEBP2 alpha</a> B genes encode the <a href="output.html#258">DNA-binding subunit</a> of a murine <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>, PEBP2, which is implicated as a T-cell-specific <a href="output.html#66">transcriptional regulator</a>.
These two related genes share the evolutionarily conserved region encoding the Runt domain.
<a href="output.html#257">PEBP2 alpha</a> B is the murine counterpart of human AML1, which is located at the breakpoints of the 8;21 and 3;21 chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia.
Northern (RNA) blots of various adult mouse tissues revealed that the levels of expression of both genes were most prominent in the thymus.
Furthermore, transcripts of <a href="output.html#257">PEBP2 alpha</a> A and mouse AML1/<a href="output.html#257">PEBP2 alpha</a> B were detected in T lymphocytes in the thymuses from day 16 embryos and newborns, as well as 4-week-old adult mice, by in <a href="output.html#240">situ hybridization</a>.
The expression of the genes persisted in peripheral lymph nodes of adult mice.
The transcripts were detected in all the CD4- CD8-, CD4+ CD8+, CD4+ CD8-, and CD4- CD8+ <a href="output.html#244">cell populations</a>.
The results indicated that both genes are expressed in T cells throughout their development, supporting the notion that PEBP2 is a T-cell-specific <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>.
Transcripts of mouse AML1/<a href="output.html#257">PEBP2 alpha</a> B were also detected in day 12 fetal hematopoietic liver and in the bone marrow cells of newborn mice.

Aspirin inhibits <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor-kappa B</a> mobilization and <a href="output.html#209">monocyte adhesion</a> in stimulated <a href="output.html#297">human endothelial cells</a>.

BACKGROUND: The induction of vascular <a href="output.html#113">cell adhesion</a> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin by <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a>-alpha (<a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>) is mediated by mobilization of the <a href="output.html#96">transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B</a> (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>).
Since salicylates have been reported to inhibit <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappa B activation</a> by preventing the degradation of its inhibitor I <a href="output.html#53">kappa B</a>, we studied a potential inhibition of this pathway by acetylsalicylate (aspirin) in human umbilical vein <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a> (HUVECs).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Gel-shift analyses demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>-induced <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> mobilization by aspirin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mmol/L.
<a href="output.html#259">Induction of VCAM-1</a> and E-selectin <a href="output.html#110">surface expression</a> by <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a> was dose-dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range, while induction of <a href="output.html#28">intercellular adhesion molecule-1</a> (<a href="output.html#28">ICAM-1</a>) was hardly affected.
Aspirin appeared to prevent VCAM-1 transcription, since it dose-dependently inhibited <a href="output.html#259">induction of VCAM-1</a> mRNA by <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>.
As a functional consequence, adhesion of U937 monocytes to <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>-stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin upregulation.
These effects of aspirin were not related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity, since indomethacin was ineffective.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> mobilization, <a href="output.html#259">induction of VCAM-1</a> and E-selectin, and subsequent <a href="output.html#209">monocyte adhesion</a> in <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a> stimulated by <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>, thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin.

<a href="output.html#10">Core binding factor</a> (<a href="output.html#10">CBF</a>), also known as polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 and SL3 enhancer factor 1, is a mammalian <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> that binds to an element termed the core within the enhancers of the murine leukemia virus family of retroviruses.
The core elements of the SL3 virus are important genetic determinants of the ability of this virus to induce T-cell lymphomas and the <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activity</a> of the viral long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes.
<a href="output.html#10">CBF</a> consists of two subunits, a <a href="output.html#258">DNA binding subunit</a>, <a href="output.html#34">CBF alpha</a>, and a second subunit, <a href="output.html#69">CBF beta</a>, that stimulates the <a href="output.html#42">DNA binding activity</a> of <a href="output.html#34">CBF alpha</a>.
One of the genes that encodes a <a href="output.html#144">CBF alpha subunit</a> is AML1, also called <a href="output.html#34">Cbf alpha</a> 2.
This locus is rearranged by chromosomal translocations in human myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias.
An exogenously expressed <a href="output.html#34">Cbf alpha</a> 2-encoded subunit (<a href="output.html#34">CBF alpha</a> 2-451) stimulated transcription from the SL3 enhancer in P19 and <a href="output.html#246">HeLa cells</a>.
Activity was mediated through the core elements.
Three different isoforms of <a href="output.html#69">CBF beta</a> were also tested for <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activity</a> on the SL3 enhancer.
The longest form, <a href="output.html#69">CBF beta</a>-187, increased the transcriptional stimulation by <a href="output.html#34">CBF alpha</a> 2-451 twofold in <a href="output.html#246">HeLa cells</a>, although it had no effect in P19 cells.
<a href="output.html#11">Transcriptional activation</a> by <a href="output.html#69">CBF beta</a> required binding to the <a href="output.html#144">CBF alpha subunit</a>, as a form of <a href="output.html#69">CBF beta</a> that lacked binding ability, <a href="output.html#69">CBF beta</a>-148, failed to increase activity.
These results indicated that at least in certain <a href="output.html#148">cell types</a>, the maximum activity of <a href="output.html#10">CBF</a> required both subunits.
They also provided support for the hypothesis that <a href="output.html#10">CBF</a> is a factor in T lymphocytes that is responsible for recognition of the SL3 cores.
We also examined whether <a href="output.html#10">CBF</a> could distinguish a 1-bp difference between the enhancer core of SL3 and the core of the nonleukemogenic virus, Akv.
This difference strongly affects <a href="output.html#210">transcription in T cells</a> and leukemogenicity of SL3.
However, no combination of <a href="output.html#34">CBF alpha</a> and <a href="output.html#69">CBF beta</a> subunits that we tested was able to distinguish the 1-bp difference in transcription assays.
Thus, a complete understanding of how T cells recognize the SL3 core remains to be elucidated.

Neutrophils and monocytes express high levels of PU.1 (Spi-1) but not Spi-B.

PU.1 (the Spi-1 oncogene) and Spi-B are closely related members of the ets <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> family, sharing similar <a href="output.html#179">DNA binding specificities</a> mediated by similar DNA binding domains.
PU.1 and Spi-B have been previously described as being predominantly expressed coordinately in macrophages and <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a>, but their expression in early hematopoietic stages and during the course of myeloid differentiation to monocytes and macrophages or to neutrophils has not been extensively investigated.
Here, we report that PU.1 mRNA is upregulated during myeloid differentiation of human purified CD34+ cells and murine multipotential FDCP-mix A4 cells, suggesting that PU.1 is upregulated as an early event during differentiation of multipotential progenitor cells.
PU.1 expression is maintained at stable levels during differentiation of myeloid <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a> U937 and HL-60 to monocytic and neutrophilic cells.
PU.1 is expressed at highest levels in mature <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a> and human <a href="output.html#19">peripheral blood</a> neutrophils.
In contrast to PU.1, significant levels of Spi-B mRNA and protein are found only in some B-<a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a> and spleen but are not found in myeloid <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a>, neutrophils, or macrophages.
In vitro translated Spi-B protein can bind to PU.1 <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a> in myeloid promoters and transactivate these promoters in nonmyeloid cells.
Therefore, although PU.1 and Spi-B may bind to similar DNA control elements and have redundancy of transactivation function in vitro, the lack of significant levels of Spi-B in <a href="output.html#161">myeloid cells</a> makes it unlikely that Spi-B plays a significant role in myeloid lineage development and <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a>.
In contrast, PU.1 is expressed at high levels not only in monocytes and macrophages but also in neutrophils, indicating that PU.1 can activate <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> in both major myeloid lineages.

Integrin-mediated <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> and cytokine message induction in <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a>.
A possible signaling role for the <a href="output.html#132">Syk tyrosine kinase</a>.

Activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases is an important aspect of <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> mediated by integrins.
In the human monocytic <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> THP-1, either integrin-dependent <a href="output.html#113">cell adhesion</a> to fibronectin or ligation of beta 1 integrins with antibodies causes a rapid and intense <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of two sets of proteins of about 65-75 and 120-125 kDa.
In addition, integrin ligation leads to <a href="output.html#108">nuclear translocation</a> of the p50 and p65 subunits of the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>, to activation of a <a href="output.html#172">reporter gene</a> driven by a promoter containing <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> sites, and to increased levels of mRNAs for <a href="output.html#211">immediate-early genes</a>, including the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta.
The <a href="output.html#260">tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein</a> and herbimycin A block both integrin-mediated <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> and increases in <a href="output.html#112">IL-1 beta</a> message levels, indicating a causal relationship between the two events.
The components tyrosine phosphorylated subsequent to <a href="output.html#113">cell adhesion</a> include paxillin, pp125FAK, and the SH2 domain containing <a href="output.html#132">tyrosine kinase Syk</a>.
In contrast, integrin ligation with antibodies induces <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of Syk but not of FAK or paxillin.
In adhering cells, pre-treatment with cytochalasin D suppresses <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of FAK and paxillin but not of Syk, while <a href="output.html#112">IL-1 beta</a> message induction is unaffected.
These observations indicate that the <a href="output.html#132">Syk tyrosine kinase</a> may be an important component of an integrin signaling pathway in <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a>, leading to <a href="output.html#6">activation of NF-kappa B</a> and to increased levels of cytokine messages.

Regulation of <a href="output.html#13">granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor</a> and E-selectin expression in <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a> by cyclosporin A and the T-cell <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> NFAT.

<a href="output.html#33">Nuclear factor</a> of activated T cells (NFAT) was originally described as a T-cell-specific <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> athat supported the activation of cytokine <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> and mediated the immunoregulatory effects of cyclosporin A (CsA).
As we observed that activated <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a> also expressed NFAT, we tested the antiinflammatory properties of CsA in <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a>.
Significantly, CsA completely suppressed the induction of NFAT in <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a> and inhibited the activity of <a href="output.html#13">granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor</a> (<a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>) gene <a href="output.html#58">regulatory elements</a> that use NFAT by 60%.
CsA similarly mediated a reduction of up to 65% in <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a> mRNA and protein expression in activated <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a>.
CsA also suppressed E-selectin, but not vascular <a href="output.html#113">cell adhesion</a> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a>, even though the E-selectin promoter is activated by <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> rather than NFAT.
Hence, induction of <a href="output.html#80">cell surface</a> expression of this leukocyte adhesion molecule by <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a> (<a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>)-alpha was reduced by 40% in the presence of CsA, and this was reflected by a 29% decrease in neutrophil adhesion.
The effects of CsA on <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a> were also detected at the chromatin structure level, as DNasel hypersensitive sites within both the <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a> enhancer and the E-selectin promoter were suppressed by CsA.
This represents the first report of NFAT in <a href="output.html#51">endothelial cells</a> and suggests mechanisms by which CsA could function as an antiinflammatory agent.

Cloning a cDNA from human NK/T cells which codes for a protein with high proline content.

A cDNA clone, B4-2, was isolated from a natural killer (NK) minus T cell subtractive library.
The B4-2 clone coded for an mRNA of 2061 bp in length.
It encodes a deduced 327 aa protein with a calculated molecular mass of 35.2 kDa.
Searching of B4-2 DNA and protein sequences against various databases revealed no high homology to other sequences.
However, B4-2 has an unusually high proline content (13%), contains a putative nuclear targeting sequence, and has several SPXX motifs which are frequently found in gene regulatory proteins.
One of the stretches of prolines in B4-2 closely resembles the ligand for proteins with SH3 domains.
Northern hybridization data showed that B4-2 is not a lymphoid specific gene and is expressed in a hepatoma <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> and also weakly transcribed or absent in a variety of other cells.
A polyclonal antiserum raised against recombinant B4-2 recognizes a 32-34 kDa protein in lymphocytes.

Down-regulation of <a href="output.html#74">NF-kappa B protein</a> levels in activated human lymphocytes by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1996 Jan 9;93(1):524]

The effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2)D3], a <a href="output.html#261">steroid hormone</a> with immunomodulating properties, on <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor kappa B</a> (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>) proteins was examined in in vitro activated normal human lymphocytes by Western blot analysis.
Over a 72-hr period of activation, the expression of the <a href="output.html#180">50-kDa NF-kappa B</a>, p50, and its precursor, p105, was increased progressively.
When cells were activated in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, the levels of the mature protein as well as its precursor were decreased.
The effect of the hormone on the levels of p50 was demonstrable in the cytosolic and <a href="output.html#152">nuclear compartments</a>; it required between 4 and 8 hr and was specific, as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and <a href="output.html#262">24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3</a> were ineffective.
Besides p50, 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased the levels of another <a href="output.html#74">NF-kappa B protein</a>, namely c-rel.
In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased the abundance of a specific DNA-protein complex formed upon incubation of <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> from activated lymphocytes with a labeled <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> <a href="output.html#191">DNA binding motif</a>.
Further, 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activity</a> of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> in <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a> transiently transfected with a construct containing four tandem repeats of the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> binding sequence of the immunoglobulin <a href="output.html#186">kappa light chain</a> gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <a href="output.html#172">reporter gene</a>.
These observations demonstrate directly that there is de novo synthesis of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> during human <a href="output.html#163">lymphocyte activation</a> and suggest that this process is hormonally regulated.

<a href="output.html#52">IFN-gamma</a> priming of monocytes enhances LPS-induced <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a> production by augmenting both transcription and MRNA stability.

The induction of cytokine expression in monocytes/macrophages by bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide is a critical, highly regulated host defence response.
The augmentation of LPS responses by <a href="output.html#52">interferon gamma</a> (<a href="output.html#52">IFN-gamma</a>), referred to as priming, is well established.
However, the mechanism(s) by which priming occurs is poorly defined.
Using tumour necrosis factor (<a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>) induction as a model, experiments were designed to analyse in detail the priming effect on the <a href="output.html#213">LPS response</a> in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a>.
Priming by <a href="output.html#52">IFN-gamma</a> was primarily manifested at the level of <a href="output.html#105">TNF mRNA accumulation</a>.
<a href="output.html#52">IFN-gamma</a> pre-treatment affected the magnitude rather than the sensitivity of the <a href="output.html#213">LPS response</a>.
Priming occurred after several hours of treatment, and the primed state was induced by either <a href="output.html#52">IFN-gamma</a> or <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>, but not M-CSF.
Primed monocytes transcribed <a href="output.html#44">TNF mRNA</a> at a higher rate than freshly isolated monocytes upon activation with LPS.
The increased transcriptional rate correlated with a marked increase in <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor-kappa B</a> activity in these cells as determined by <a href="output.html#14">electrophoretic mobility shift assay</a> using a consensus <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> oligonucleotide.
An additional significant finding was than <a href="output.html#44">TNF mRNA</a> induced in primed cells was much more stable than in <a href="output.html#263">unprimed cells</a> (T1/2 increased 6-8-fold).
Consistent with the increased mRNA stability, the duration of mRNA accumulation was longer following <a href="output.html#212">LPS stimulation</a> in primed monocytes, in addition to being of greater magnitude.
Finally, primed and <a href="output.html#263">unprimed cells</a> possessed a differential sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor H-89.
H-89 substantially suppressed LPS-induced <a href="output.html#105">TNF mRNA accumulation</a> in <a href="output.html#263">unprimed cells</a>, but had no effect on primed monocytes following <a href="output.html#212">LPS stimulation</a>.

Prolactin and interleukin-2 receptors in T lymphocytes signal through a MGF-STAT5-like <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>.

The <a href="output.html#80">cell surface</a> receptors for PRL and interleukin-2 (IL-2) are structurally distinct, but share regulatory tasks in T lymphocytes.
They can stimulate proliferation and activate transcription of over-lapping sets of <a href="output.html#103">genes of T cells</a>.
PRL and <a href="output.html#94">IL-2 receptor</a> activation are both linked to the Jak/Stat (<a href="output.html#31">signal transducer</a> and <a href="output.html#11">activator of transcription</a>) pathway.
We investigated the ability of PRL and IL-2 to activate <a href="output.html#114">Stat proteins</a> in different T <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a>.
The <a href="output.html#179">DNA binding specificities</a>, the reactivities toward Stat-specific antisera, and the mol wt of IL-2 -and PRL-induced DNA-<a href="output.html#168">binding proteins</a> in Nb2 and C196 T <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a> were investigated.
A comparison with the <a href="output.html#114">Stat proteins</a> induced by interferon-gamma, PRL, and IL-6 in T47D mammary tumor cells was made.
We found that these parameters were indistinguishable for one of the PRL- and IL-2-induced factors.
A <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> closely related to mammary gland factor-Stat5 is rapidly activated upon interaction of IL-2 and PRL with their respective receptors.
Activation of a second protein related to Stat1 was also observed.
Our results emphasize the role of PRL as a regulator of the <a href="output.html#151">immune response</a> and indicate that the Stat factors mammary gland factor-Stat5 and Stat1 play a role in the <a href="output.html#181">regulation of gene expression</a> during T <a href="output.html#241">cell development</a>.

Interleukin-7 can induce the activation of Jak 1, Jak 3 and STAT 5 proteins in <a href="output.html#126">murine T cells</a>.

The activation of Janus <a href="output.html#21">protein tyrosine kinases</a> (Jak) and STAT (<a href="output.html#31">signal transducer</a> and <a href="output.html#11">activator of transcription</a>) proteins has recently been linked to the <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> mechanism of several cytokines.
IL-7 was observed to induce a rapid and dose-dependent <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of Jak 1 and Jak 3 and concomitantly, the <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> and <a href="output.html#42">DNA binding activity</a> of multiple <a href="output.html#114">STAT proteins</a>.
The <a href="output.html#114">STAT proteins</a> utilized by IL-7 were identical to those induced by IL-2 and could be identified as various STAT 5 isoforms.
Moreover, the induction of both Jak 1 and 3, and STAT 5 activity strongly correlated with the growth-promoting effects of IL-7, suggesting that this <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> mechanism may play a key role in IL-7-induced proliferation.

Coexpression of the interleukin-13 and interleukin-4 genes correlates with their <a href="output.html#214">physical linkage</a> in the cytokine gene cluster on human chromosome 5q23-31.

Interleukin-13 (IL-13) and IL-4 are cytokines produced by T cells that are encoded by the q23-31 region of human chromosome 5.
To investigate the regulation of <a href="output.html#242">IL-13 gene</a> expression by T cells, we isolated and sequenced the human <a href="output.html#242">IL-13 gene</a>, analyzed its 5'-flanking region for potential <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activation</a> elements, and examined its expression in nontransformed T-lineage <a href="output.html#244">cell populations</a>.
The human <a href="output.html#242">IL-13 gene</a> was located 12.5-kb upstream of the <a href="output.html#264">IL-4 gene</a> and 2-kb downstream of a CpG island.
The <a href="output.html#242">IL-13 gene</a> 5' flank region included a segment with sequence homology to <a href="output.html#115">P elements</a> of the <a href="output.html#215">IL-4 promoter</a> involved in <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activation</a> in T cells.
Mutation of the IL-13 <a href="output.html#115">P element</a> site significantly reduced IL-13 <a href="output.html#83">promoter activity</a> in response to <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a>.
Oligonucleotides containing the IL-13 or IL-4 <a href="output.html#115">P element</a> sites specifically bound the <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activator</a> protein, <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a>-activated T cells, preformed (NF-ATp), when incubated with nuclear protein extracts from activated T cells.
Similar to IL-4, IL-13 mRNA expression was highest in T-<a href="output.html#244">cell populations</a> enriched for cells that had previously been primed in vivo or in vitro, indicating that priming increases the expression of the IL-13 and <a href="output.html#264">IL-4 genes</a> in a coordinate manner.
Because the primed T cells contain higher levels of nuclear NF-ATp, capable of binding to <a href="output.html#115">P elements</a> of the IL-4 and IL-13 promoters, than do freshly-isolated T cells, the NF-AT-binding <a href="output.html#115">P elements</a> are attractive candidates to mediate the coordinate expression of these two <a href="output.html#116">cytokine genes</a>.

Trapoxin is a microbially derived cyclotetrapeptide that inhibits histone deacetylation in vivo and causes mammalian cells to arrest in the <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a>.
A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two <a href="output.html#117">nuclear proteins</a> that copurified with <a href="output.html#216">histone deacetylase</a> activity.

As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast <a href="output.html#66">transcriptional regulator</a> Rpd3p, these results support a role for <a href="output.html#216">histone deacetylase</a> as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription.

cAMP inducibility of transcriptional repressor <a href="output.html#70">ICER</a> in developing and mature <a href="output.html#43">human T lymphocytes</a> [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1996 Jul 23;93(15):8154]

Stimulation of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway exerts an <a href="output.html#159">inhibitory effect</a> on the proliferation and effector functions of T cells.
The ability of T cells to form high intracellular levels of cAMP is acquired during development in the human thymus and is retained by the majority of mature peripheral T lymphocytes.
Here we show that elevated cAMP levels in T cells correlate with the expression of the potent transcriptional repressor <a href="output.html#70">ICER</a> (<a href="output.html#70">inducible cAMP early repressor</a>) previously described in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
Further, in transcriptional assays in vivo, <a href="output.html#70">ICER</a> inhibits calcineurin-mediated expression of the interleukin 2 promoter as well as Tax-mediated transactivation of the human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) promoter.
Thus, the induction of <a href="output.html#70">ICER</a> in T cells may play an important role in the cAMP-induced quiescence and the persistent latency of HTLV-I.

Age-related decreases in <a href="output.html#79">IL-2 production</a> by <a href="output.html#9">human T cells</a> are associated with impaired activation of nuclear <a href="output.html#176">transcriptional factors AP-1</a> and NF-AT.

Although <a href="output.html#176">transcriptional factors AP-1</a> and <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> of activated T cells (NF-AT) are important for the normal induction of IL-2, it is unknown if the age-related decline in <a href="output.html#79">IL-2 production</a> by activated <a href="output.html#9">human T cells</a> may be associated with aberrancies in transcriptional regulatory proteins.
In the current studies, <a href="output.html#79">IL-2 production</a> by T cells from elderly (mean 78 years) and young (mean 37 years) humans was measured in cultures stimulated with PHA, PHA plus <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>, crosslinked anti-CD3 mAB OKT3 plus <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>, or <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a> plus ionomycin.
Substantial decreases of <a href="output.html#79">IL-2 production</a> were observed for <a href="output.html#217">cell cultures</a> from 7 of 12 elderly individuals in response to the different stimuli, whereas the levels of IL-2 produced by stimulated T cells from other elderly individuals were equivalent to those observed for stimulated T cells of young subjects.
Analyses of <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays showed that decreased <a href="output.html#79">IL-2 production</a> by stimulated T cells of elderly individuals was closely associated with impairments in the activation of both <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 and NF-AT.
By contrast, T cells from elderly subjects with normal levels of <a href="output.html#79">IL-2 production</a> exhibited normal <a href="output.html#218">activation of AP-1</a> and NF-AT.
In addition, the results of competition experiments analyzing the normal components of NF-AT showed that the age-related reductions in stimulus-dependent NF-AT complexes corresponded to the slow migrating complexes that were composed of c-Fos/c-Jun <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1.
The resting and stimulated levels of <a href="output.html#3">NF kappa B</a> were reduced in T cells from certain elderly individuals; however, alterations of <a href="output.html#3">NF kappa B</a> did not correlate with changes in <a href="output.html#160">IL-2 expression</a>.
Thus, these results show that age-related impairments in the <a href="output.html#218">activation of AP-1</a> and NF-AT are closely associated with decreased <a href="output.html#160">expression of IL-2</a> and further suggest that aberrancies in the signaling pathways important for the induction of transcriptionally active c-Fos/c-Jun <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 may contribute to the impaired <a href="output.html#219">activation of NF-AT</a>.

<a href="output.html#11">Transcriptional activation</a> of RNA polymerase III-dependent genes by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 <a href="output.html#265">tax protein</a>.

The human T-cell leukemia virus-encoded <a href="output.html#265">tax protein</a> is a <a href="output.html#266">potent activator</a> of many viral and cellular genes transcribed by <a href="output.html#182">RNA polymerase II</a>.
We find that both chromatin and cell extracts derived from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-infected <a href="output.html#43">human T lymphocytes</a> support higher levels of 5S rRNA and tRNA <a href="output.html#37">gene transcription</a> than chromatin or extracts from uninfected T lymphocytes.
The viral protein Tax was likely responsible for this higher level of class II <a href="output.html#37">gene transcription</a>, as purified Tax was found to stimulate both genes when added to the uninfected cell extract or in reconstituted systems.
Both limiting-component transcription assays and DNA binding assays identified the class III <a href="output.html#37">gene transcription</a> factor TFIIIB as the principle target of Tax activity.
Surprisingly, we find that Tax increases the effective concentration of active TFIIIB molecules.
These data suggest that Tax stimulates RNA polymerase III-dependent <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> by accelerating the rate and/or extent of transcription initiation complex assembly.

Multiple <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> are required for activation of <a href="output.html#267">human interleukin</a> 9 <a href="output.html#103">gene in T cells</a>.

The genetic elements and regulatory mechanisms responsible for <a href="output.html#267">human interleukin</a> 9 (IL-9) <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> in a human T cell leukemia virus type I-transformed human T <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a>, C5MJ2, were investigated.
We demonstrated that <a href="output.html#143">IL-9 gene</a> expression is controlled, at least in part, by <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activation</a>.
<a href="output.html#141">Transient expression</a> of the luciferase <a href="output.html#172">reporter gene</a> linked to serially deleted sequences of the 5'-flanking region of the <a href="output.html#143">IL-9 gene</a> has revealed several positive and negative <a href="output.html#58">regulatory elements</a> involved in the basal and <a href="output.html#268">inducible expression</a> of the <a href="output.html#143">IL-9 gene</a> in C5MJ2 cells.
An <a href="output.html#269">AP-1 site</a> at -146 to -140 was shown to be involved in the expression of the <a href="output.html#143">IL-9 gene</a>.
A proximal region between -46 and -80 was identified as the minimum sequence for the basal and <a href="output.html#268">inducible expression</a> of the <a href="output.html#143">IL-9 gene</a> in C5MJ2 cells.
Within this region, an <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> site at -59 to -50 and its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence were demonstrated to play a critical role for the IL-9 <a href="output.html#83">promoter activity</a>.
DNA-protein binding studies indicated that <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>, c-Jun, and potentially novel proteins (around 35 kDa) can bind to this important sequence.
Mutations at different sites within this proximal promoter region abolished the <a href="output.html#83">promoter activity</a> as well as the DNA binding.
Taken together, these results suggest that the cooperation of different <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> is essential for <a href="output.html#143">IL-9 gene</a> expression in T cells.

<a href="output.html#37">Gene transcription</a> through activation of G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors.

Receptors for leukocyte chemoattractants, including chemokines, are traditionally considered to be responsible for the activation of special leukocyte functions such as chemotaxis, degranulation, and the release of superoxide anions.
Recently, these G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors have been found to transduce signals leading to <a href="output.html#37">gene transcription</a> and translation in leukocytes.
<a href="output.html#4">Transcription factors</a>, such as <a href="output.html#3">NF kappa B</a> and <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1, are activated upon stimulation of the cells with several chemoattractants at physiologically relevant concentrations.
<a href="output.html#75">Activation of transcription factors</a> through these receptors involves G-protein coupling and the <a href="output.html#57">activation of protein kinases</a>.
The underlying signaling pathways appear to be different from those utilized by <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>, a better characterized cytokine that induces the transcription of <a href="output.html#211">immediate-early genes</a>.
Chemoattractants stimulate the expression of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which in turn may activate their respective receptors and initiate an autocrine regulatory mechanism for persistent cytokine and chemokine <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a>.

Inhibition of <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> Stat1 activity in mononuclear <a href="output.html#217">cell cultures</a> and T cells by the cyclic AMP signaling pathway.

<a href="output.html#29">Activation of T cells</a> results in a cascade of gene activation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into effector phenotypes.
The regulation of <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> belonging to the <a href="output.html#31">signal transducer</a> and <a href="output.html#11">activator of transcription</a> (STAT) family was analyzed in PHA-activated mononuclear cells and in purified T cells activated by cross-linking <a href="output.html#80">cell surface</a> CD3.
<a href="output.html#29">Cell activation</a> resulted in a delayed induction of STAT <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a>, which was sustained for several days, was composed predominantly of Stat1 and Stat3, and was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D.
Increased Stat1 and Stat3 mRNA and protein levels were detected, respectively 4 and 24 h after activation.
Stimulation of the cAMP <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> pathway, which skews <a href="output.html#220">cytokine production</a> toward a Th2 pattern, resulted in the preferential suppression of Stat1 activity.
cAMP inhibited the <a href="output.html#118">induction of expression</a> of IL-2 receptor components, but did not inhibit <a href="output.html#221">IL-4 receptor</a> alpha-chain and CD69 expression or the induction of <a href="output.html#24">activator protein</a> 1 <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a>.
cAMP signaling inhibited Stat1 at several different levels, including suppression of DNA binding and down-regulation of Stat1 protein and mRNA levels.
Our results demonstrate the regulation of STAT activity by a signaling pathway that regulates the T cell functional phenotype and is distinct from the cytokine-activated <a href="output.html#270">Janus kinase</a>-STAT signaling pathway.

<a href="output.html#13">Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor</a> preferentially activates the <a href="output.html#222">94-kD STAT5A</a> and an 80-kD STAT5A isoform in <a href="output.html#155">human peripheral blood monocytes</a>.

<a href="output.html#13">Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor</a> (<a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>) induces immediate effects in monocytes by activation of the <a href="output.html#270">Janus kinase</a> (JAK2) and STAT <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> (STAT5) pathway.
Recent studies have identified homologues of STAT5, STAT5A, and STAT5B, as well as lower <a href="output.html#271">molecular weight</a> variants of STAT5.
To define the activation of the STAT5 homologues and lower <a href="output.html#271">molecular weight</a> variant in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a> and monocytes differentiated into macrophages by culture in macrophage-CSF (M-CSF), we measured the <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a> induced <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of STAT5A, STAT5B, and any lower <a href="output.html#271">molecular weight</a> STAT5 isoforms.
Freshly isolated monocytes expressed <a href="output.html#222">94-kD STAT5A</a>, 92-kD STAT5B, and an 80-kD STAT5A molecule.
Whereas <a href="output.html#222">94-kD STAT5A</a> was clearly tyrosine phosphorylated and bound to the enhancer element, the <a href="output.html#133">gamma response region</a> (<a href="output.html#133">GRR</a>), of the Fc gamma RI gene, substantially less tyrosine phosphorylated STAT5B bound to the immobilized <a href="output.html#133">GRR</a> element.
Macrophages lost their ability to express the 80-kD STAT5A protein, but retained their ability to activate STAT5A.
STAT5A-STAT5A homodimers and STAT5A-STAT5B heterodimers formed in response to <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>.
Therefore, activation of STAT5A predominates compared to STAT5B when assayed by direct immunoprecipitation and by evaluation of bound STATs to immobilized <a href="output.html#133">GRR</a>.
Selective activation of STAT5 homologues in addition to generation of lower molecular isoforms may provide specificity and control to genes expressed in response to cytokines such as <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>.

<a href="output.html#67">CTL</a> recognition of an altered peptide associated with asparagine bond rearrangement.
Implications for immunity and vaccine design.

The extent to which peptides containing chemically and post-translationally modified amino acid side chains are recognized by primed <a href="output.html#67">CTL</a> has not been clearly defined.
We report on the <a href="output.html#67">CTL</a> recognition of a MHC class I-restricted peptide containing a cyclized asparagine (succinimide) residue.
This modification of the asparagine side chain is a common intermediate structure during deamidation, isomerization, and bond rearrangements of amide-containing <a href="output.html#227">amino acids</a> and also occurs as a side reaction in peptide synthesis.
The <a href="output.html#67">CTL</a> specifically recognized the succinimide-containing peptide showing only weak cross-reactivity at high concentrations of the parent peptide containing unmodified asparagine.
Similarly, <a href="output.html#67">CTL</a> raised against the parent peptide did not recognize the succinimide derivative of this peptide.
Naturally processed forms of these structures are likely to occur given the importance and frequency of deamidation both in vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, since succinimide intermediates of deamidated peptides can occasionally be very stable, these peptides have the potential to act as altered self-Ags with significant implications for autoimmunity.
In addition, unwanted and potentially hazardous specificities may be elicited when using synthetic peptides in subunit vaccines in which succinimide residues may form spontaneously during storage or chemical synthesis.

Retinoid differentiation therapy in promyelocytic leukemia.

<a href="output.html#134">Acute promyelocytic leukemia</a> (<a href="output.html#134">APL</a>) is a specific type of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the morphology of the blast cells, a specific t(15;17) translocation, and risks of definite coagulopathy.

E3, a hematopoietic-specific transcript directly regulated by the <a href="output.html#62">retinoic acid receptor alpha</a>.

<a href="output.html#12">Retinoic acid</a> (<a href="output.html#12">RA</a>)-induced maturation mediated by the <a href="output.html#62">retinoic acid receptor alpha</a> (<a href="output.html#62">RAR alpha</a>) has been implicated in myeloid development.
We have used differential hybridization analysis of a cDNA library constructed from the murine <a href="output.html#12">RA</a>-inducible MPRO promyelocyte <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> to identify <a href="output.html#211">immediate-early genes</a> induced by <a href="output.html#12">RA</a> during granulocytic differentiation.
E3, one of nine sequences identified, was upregulated in an immediate-early manner, with transcript levels peaking after 60 minutes exposure to <a href="output.html#12">RA</a>.
E3 transcripts were <a href="output.html#12">RA</a>-inducible in <a href="output.html#248">HL60 cells</a>, but not in an <a href="output.html#12">RA</a>-resistant subclone, HL60R, that harbors a mutated <a href="output.html#62">RAR alpha</a> gene.
However, when HL60R cells were transduced with a functional copy of the <a href="output.html#62">RAR alpha</a> gene, <a href="output.html#12">RA</a> induced a 10-fold increase in E3 mRNA levels.
E3 transcripts are present in the myeloid, B-lymphoid, and erythroid lineages, absent in nonhematopoietic cells, and encode a highly hydrophobic, potentially phosphorylated polypeptide of unknown function with significant homology to a putative protein expressed in <a href="output.html#161">myeloid cells</a>.
The murine E3 promoter harbors a single bipartite <a href="output.html#12">retinoic acid</a> <a href="output.html#64">response element</a> which in <a href="output.html#223">transient transfection</a> assays conferred <a href="output.html#12">RA</a> sensitivity.

Stimulation of human lymphocyte proliferation and <a href="output.html#224">CD40 antigen</a> expression by phosphorothioate oligonucleotides complementary to hepatitis B virus genome.

We have studied the proliferation and <a href="output.html#224">CD40 antigen</a> expression of lymphocytes, and the cytotoxicity to monocytes, of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the SP II promoter of HBV mRNA (sequence I) and the X gene (sequence II) in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
The oligo sequence I stimulated proliferation of both T and, to a lesser extent, <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a>.
The percentage of cells expressing CD40 in T and B cell co-cultures increased from 4.2% to 13.8% after oligo stimulation in patients, while it increased form 4.7% to 48.6% in healthy controls.
The sense sequence (sequence III) of the X gene also enhanced the <a href="output.html#183">expression of CD40 antigen</a> in <a href="output.html#184">patients with hepatitis B</a>.
The proportion of CD40 cells (26%) in a resting B-cell preparation from hepatitis B patients decreased to zero after a 5-day culture with sequence I, but IgG levels in the culture supernatant increased.
The cytotoxic properties of monocytes were not influenced by the oligos.
These findings indicate that antisense oligos against hepatitis B virus (HBV) have mitogenic effects on the proliferation of human lymphocytes in a non-specific manner and may activate T cells to express <a href="output.html#224">CD40 antigen</a>.

Dual action of <a href="output.html#12">retinoic acid</a> on human embryonic/fetal hematopoiesis: blockade of primitive progenitor proliferation and shift from multipotent/erythroid/monocytic to granulocytic differentiation program.

In preliminary studies, we have analyzed the <a href="output.html#185">hematopoietic growth factor</a> (<a href="output.html#185">HGF</a>) requirement of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) purified from <a href="output.html#162">embryonic-fetal liver</a> (<a href="output.html#162">FL</a>) and grown in fetal calf serum-supplemented (FCS+) clonogenic culture.
The key role of erythropoietin (Epo) for colony formation by early erythroid progenitors (burst-forming units-erythroid [BFU-E]) has been confirmed.
Furthermore, in the absence of exogenous HGFs, <a href="output.html#162">FL</a> monocytic progenitors (colony-forming unit monocyte [CFU-M]) generate large colonies exclusively composed of monocytes-macrophages; these colonies are absent in FCS- clonogenic culture.
On this basis, we have investigated the role of <a href="output.html#76">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (<a href="output.html#76">ATRA</a>) and its isomer 9-cis <a href="output.html#12">RA</a> in <a href="output.html#162">FL</a> hematopoiesis.
Both compounds modulate the growth of purified <a href="output.html#162">FL</a> HPCs, which show a dose-dependent shift from mixed/erythroid/monocytic to granulocytic colony formation.
Studies on unicellular and paired daughter cell culture unequivocally indicate that the shift is mediated by modulation of the HPC differentiation program to the granulopoietic pathway (rather than <a href="output.html#12">RA</a>-induced down-modulation of multipotent /erythroid/monocytic HPC growth coupled with recruitment of granulocytic HPCs).
<a href="output.html#76">ATRA</a> and 9-cis <a href="output.html#12">RA</a> also exert their effect on the proliferation of primitive HPCs (high-proliferative potential colony-forming cells [HPP-CFCs]) and putative hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs; assayed in Dexter-type long-term culture).
High concentrations of either compound (1) drastically reduced the number of primary HPP-CFC colonies and totally abolished their recloning capacity and (2) inhibited HSC proliferation.
It is crucial that these results mirror recent observations indicating that murine adult HPCs transduced with dominant negative <a href="output.html#76">ATRA</a> receptor (<a href="output.html#30">RAR</a>) gene are immortalized and show a selective blockade of granulocytic differentiation.
Altogether, these results suggest that <a href="output.html#76">ATRA</a>/9-cis <a href="output.html#12">RA</a> may play a key role in <a href="output.html#162">FL</a> hematopoiesis via a dual effect hypothetically mediated by interaction with the <a href="output.html#30">RAR</a>/<a href="output.html#41">RXR</a> heterodimer, ie, inhibition of HSC/ primitive HPC proliferation and induction of CFU-GEMM/ BFU-E/CFU-M shift from the multipotent/erythroid/monocytic to the granulocytic-neutrophilic differentiation program.

<a href="output.html#23">Tyrosine kinase</a> and cAMP-dependent <a href="output.html#8">protein kinase</a> activities in CD40-activated human <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a>.

In vitro, human <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a> undergo long-term proliferation when activated through CD40, a protein expressed on their <a href="output.html#80">cell surface</a>.
The nature of CD40-dependent signals in proliferating fresh human <a href="output.html#50">Epstein-Barr virus</a>-negative <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a> is currently unknown.
In this study, a CD40-dependent B cell culture system was used to examine the role of different <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> elements.
<a href="output.html#20">Protein kinase C</a> (<a href="output.html#20">PKC</a>) depletion generated by a long-term phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate treatment had weak effects on proliferation.
Rather, <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> was shown to be directly involved in mediating CD40-dependent signals.
The use of the <a href="output.html#21">protein tyrosine kinase</a> (<a href="output.html#21">PTK</a>)-specific inhibitor herbimycin A dramatically decreased <a href="output.html#205">cellular proliferation</a> without altering the activity of the <a href="output.html#18">human immunodeficiency virus</a>-1 long terminal repeat (<a href="output.html#272">HIV-1 LTR</a>), a promoter largely dependent on the binding of <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor kappa B</a> (NF- kappa B).
In contrast, the cAMP-dependent <a href="output.html#8">protein kinase</a> specific inhibitor H-89 totally inhibited <a href="output.html#272">HIV-1 LTR</a> activity at a concentration as low as 100 nM without affecting <a href="output.html#205">cellular proliferation</a>.
<a href="output.html#14">Electrophoretic mobility shift assay</a> (<a href="output.html#14">EMSA</a>) and <a href="output.html#273">supershift assay</a> using an <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> binding sequence from the <a href="output.html#186">kappa light chain</a> as a probe, revealed that both p65 (RelA) and c-Rel were present in CD40-stimulated <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a>.
While <a href="output.html#20">PKC</a> depletion did not alter the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> level, treatment of <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a> with H-89 or herbimycin A provoked a decrease in the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> level.

Lack of IL-12 signaling in human allergen-specific Th2 cells.

IL-12 is a powerful skewer of CD4+ T <a href="output.html#97">cell responses</a> toward the Th1 phenotype by inducing <a href="output.html#135">IFN-gamma production</a> in <a href="output.html#274">naive Th cells</a>.
In the present study we addressed the question of whether IL-12 can reverse established Th2 responses into Th1/Th0 responses by inducing <a href="output.html#135">IFN-gamma production</a> in memory Th2 cells.
To this aim, allergen-specific CD4+ T cell clones (TCC) were generated from the <a href="output.html#19">peripheral blood</a> of three atopic patients, and their <a href="output.html#299">cytokine profiles</a> were analyzed.
The majority of these TCC exhibited a strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profile, and the <a href="output.html#135">production of IFN-gamma</a> could not be induced by exogenous IL-12.
Only those TCC with low <a href="output.html#52">IFN-gamma</a> levels in the absence of IL-12 responded to IL-12 by additional enhancement of <a href="output.html#135">IFN-gamma production</a>.
The IL-12 nonresponsiveness of the Th2 clones was further evident by the total lack of IL-12-induced phosphorylation of STAT4 (<a href="output.html#31">signal transducer</a> and <a href="output.html#11">activator of transcription</a>-4), a <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> that is typically involved in IL-12 signaling.
Consequently, IL-12 also failed to induce the <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a> of STAT4-containing complexes in the nuclei of these Th2 clones.
All TCC expressed equal levels of the low-affinity IL-12R beta1 subunit.
Our results indicate that human allergen-specific Th cells with strongly polarized Th2 <a href="output.html#299">cytokine profiles</a> do not respond to IL-12 and, therefore, cannot be induced to produce <a href="output.html#52">IFN-gamma</a>.
The apparent high frequency of IL-12-nonresponsive Th cells within the allergen-specific populations in atopic patients predicts a limited skewing potential of IL-12 in the case of established Th2 responses, but only affecting newly recruited <a href="output.html#274">naive Th cells</a>.

<a href="output.html#3">Nuclear factor-kappaB</a> activation in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a> stimulated with lipopolysaccharide is inhibited by fibroblast conditioned medium and exogenous <a href="output.html#124">PGE2</a>.

The <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor kappaB</a> (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>) is thought to be crucially involved in the gene activation of several cytokines, including <a href="output.html#1">tumor necrosis factor alpha</a> (<a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>).
Previously, we showed that fibroblast conditioned medium (FCM) is able to inhibit both <a href="output.html#105">TNF mRNA accumulation</a> and protein release in <a href="output.html#19">peripheral blood</a>-derived <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a> (PBM) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
In this study we have investigated the effect of FCM on the LPS-induced <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a> of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>, by means of electrophoretic shift assay (<a href="output.html#14">EMSA</a>).
We provide evidence that FCM strongly inhibits the <a href="output.html#56">LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation</a> in PBM.
Furthermore, we show that exogenous <a href="output.html#124">PGE2</a> mimics the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> <a href="output.html#159">inhibitory effect</a> of FCM.
On the other hand, FCM produced in the presence of indomethacin does not inhibit <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappaB activation</a> by LPS.
Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that inflammatory and <a href="output.html#151">immune responses</a> of monocytes/macrophages may be modulated at the molecular level by signals originating from tissue structural cells such as fibroblasts.

Interleukin-4 signaling in <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a> from patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an important cytokine for B and T lymphocyte function and mediates its effects via a receptor that contains gammac.
<a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> derived from patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) are deficient in gammac and provide a useful model in which to dissect the role of this subunit in IL-4-mediated signaling.
We found that although IL-4 stimulation of X-SCID <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> did not result in Janus <a href="output.html#23">tyrosine kinase</a>-3 (JAK3) phosphorylation, other IL-4 substrates including JAK1 and IRS-1 were phosphorylated.
Additionally, we detected <a href="output.html#31">signal transducers</a> and <a href="output.html#11">activators of transcription</a> 6 (STAT6) <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> and <a href="output.html#42">DNA binding activity</a> in X-SCID <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> with a wide range of gammac mutations.
However, reconstitution of these X-SCID <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> with gammac enhanced IL-4-mediated responses including STAT6 phosphorylation and <a href="output.html#42">DNA binding activity</a> and resulted in increased CD23 expression.
Thus, gammac is not necessary to trigger IL-4-mediated responses in <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a>, but its presence is important for optimal IL-4-signaling.
These results suggest that two distinct IL-4 signaling pathways exist.

Nuclear Rel-A and c-Rel protein complexes are differentially distributed within <a href="output.html#275">human thymocytes</a>.

<a href="output.html#3">Nuclear factor-kappa B</a> (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>)/<a href="output.html#153">Rel proteins</a> are inducible transcriptional regulators of numerous cellular genes.
They are particularly abundant in lymphoid tissues and are thought to be critical for the <a href="output.html#37">transcription of genes</a> involved in immune and <a href="output.html#225">inflammatory responses</a>.
We have reported previously that a <a href="output.html#73">nuclear NF-kappa B</a> activity was present in freshly extracted <a href="output.html#275">human thymocytes</a> in the absence of in vitro treatment of these cells.
In the present report, we identified <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> proteins extracted from human thymocyte nuclei as being p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel complexes.
Immunochemical and immunofluorescent staining of thymus sections using specific Abs allowed visualization of <a href="output.html#73">nuclear NF-kappa B</a> proteins in both thymocytes and nonthymocyte cells.
This detection suggested a preferential activation of p50/c-Rel in medullary thymocytes, whereas p50/p65 was present in both cortical and medullary regions of human thymus lobules.
However, the intensity of p65 labeling was much higher in several thymocytes from the medulla.
p65, p50, and c-Rel activities were found in both CD4- and CD8-positive thymocytes.
These observations suggest that p65 and c-Rel complexes play distinct roles in <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> and that both forms of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> play critical roles during late stages of the intrathymic maturation of T cells.

Involvement of an SAF-like <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> in the activation of serum amyloid A gene in monocyte/macrophage cells by lipopolysaccharide.

Serum amyloid A (SAA) has been linked to atherosclerosis because of its ability to remodel high-density lipoprotein by the depletion of apolipoprotein A1, its ability to bind cholesterol, and its presence in the atherosclerotic plaques of coronary and carotid arteries.
In the present study, we investigated the induction mechanism of <a href="output.html#276">SAA gene</a> in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells which play a critical role in the development of atherosclerotic fatty streak and plaque formation.
We and others have shown that <a href="output.html#276">SAA gene</a> is induced in monocyte/macrophage cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
By promoter function analysis, we show that the SAA promoter sequence between -280 and -226 can confer <a href="output.html#213">LPS responsiveness</a>.
Gel <a href="output.html#14">electrophoretic mobility shift assay</a> detected an induced <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a> in these <a href="output.html#97">cells in response</a> to LPS.
Characterization of the DNA-binding protein by UV cross-linking, Southwestern blot, and antibody ablation/supershift assays revealed that it is similar to a recently reported <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> designated SAF.
These results demonstrated that LPS-mediated <a href="output.html#276">SAA gene</a> induction in monocyte/macrophage cells is primarily due to the induction of SAF activity.

Homodimerization of the <a href="output.html#267">human interleukin</a> 4 <a href="output.html#201">receptor alpha chain</a> induces <a href="output.html#85">Cepsilon germline transcripts</a> in <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> in the absence of the interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain.

The cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 play a critical role in inducing <a href="output.html#85">Cepsilon germline transcripts</a> and IgE isotype switching in human <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a>.
The <a href="output.html#221">IL-4 receptor</a> (<a href="output.html#221">IL-4R</a>) in <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> is composed of two chains, the IL-4-binding <a href="output.html#226">IL-4Ralpha chain</a>, which is shared with the IL-13R, and the IL-2Rgamma (gammac) chain, which is shared with IL-7R, IL-9R, and IL-15R.
IL-4 induces <a href="output.html#85">Cepsilon germline transcripts</a> and IgE isotype switching in <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> from patients with gammac chain deficiency.
Induction of <a href="output.html#85">Cepsilon germline transcripts</a> by IL-4 in <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> that lack the gammac chain may involve signaling via the IL-13R.
Alternatively, the <a href="output.html#226">IL-4Ralpha chain</a> may transduce intracellular signals that lead to Cepsilon <a href="output.html#37">gene transcription</a> independently of its association with other chains.
We show that ligand-induced homodimerization of chimeric surface receptors consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the erythropoietin receptor and of the intracellular domain of IL-4Ralpha induces <a href="output.html#270">Janus kinase</a> 1 (Jak1) activation, STAT6 activation, and <a href="output.html#85">Cepsilon germline transcripts</a> in human B <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> BJAB.
Disruption of the Jak1-binding proline-rich Box1 region of IL-4Ralpha abolished signaling by this chimeric receptor.
Furthermore, <a href="output.html#26">B cells</a> transfected with a chimeric CD8alpha/IL-4Ralpha receptor, which is expressed on the <a href="output.html#80">cell surface</a> as a homodimer, constitutively expressed <a href="output.html#85">Cepsilon germline transcripts</a>.
These results suggest that homodimerization of the <a href="output.html#226">IL-4Ralpha chain</a> is sufficient to transduce Jak1-dependent intracellular signals that lead to IgE isotype switching.

Abnormal T lymphocyte development induced by targeted overexpression of IkappaB alpha.

A role in thymic maturation for factors of the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> family has long been suspected, but not yet proven.
Transgenic mice with a lymphocyte-specific defect in <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappaB activation</a> were produced by targeted expression of human IkappaB alpha.
The thymic cellularity of these mice was significantly decreased.
The proportion of mature, TCRhigh thymocytes of the alphabeta lineage was reduced, and the remaining TCRhigh population contained an unusually high proportion of double-positive cells.
This defect in maturation resulted in a transgene dose-dependent reduction in peripheral T lymphocytes, with the CD8 lineage being more severely affected.
These data provide direct evidence for the involvement of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>/Rel <a href="output.html#95">family proteins</a> in late stages of T lymphocyte development, coincident with positive and negative selection.

<a href="output.html#11">Transcriptional activity</a> and constitutive nuclear localization of the ETS protein Elf-1.

Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> that belongs to the <a href="output.html#95">ETS protein family</a>.
It can bind to DNA target sequences within a variety of <a href="output.html#116">cytokine genes</a>.
We demonstrate that Elf-1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus which is dependent on the presence of <a href="output.html#227">amino acids</a> 86-265.
Analysis of Gal4-Elf-1 fusion proteins revealed that the N-terminal 86 <a href="output.html#227">amino acids</a> of Elf-1 contain a <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activation</a> domain, the activity of which is attenuated by an internal repression domain.
Furthermore, Elf-1 interacts specifically with the E74 target sequence and can stimulate transcription driven by the E74 site independent of mitogenic signaling.
Thus, Elf-1 is able to stimulate <a href="output.html#37">gene transcription</a> which may be required for the development and <a href="output.html#163">activity of lymphocytes</a>.

Involvement of Rel, Fos, and Jun proteins in <a href="output.html#63">binding activity</a> to the <a href="output.html#119">IL-2 promoter</a> <a href="output.html#77">CD28 response element</a>/<a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 sequence in <a href="output.html#9">human T cells</a>.

CD28 is an important costimulatory molecule in the <a href="output.html#187">activation of human T cells</a>.
Costimulation of T cells through both the Ag receptor and CD28 leads to high level <a href="output.html#79">IL-2 production</a>, which is vital to the development of an <a href="output.html#151">immune response</a> in vivo.
Previous reports have suggested the CD28 stimulation contributes to the activation of the <a href="output.html#119">IL-2 promoter</a> by up-regulating the activity of several <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a>, including <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 and <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor-kappaB</a> (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>)/Rel <a href="output.html#164">family members</a> as well as an uncharacterized <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> called CD28 response complex.
While several lines of investigation have suggested that <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>/Rel <a href="output.html#164">family members</a> make up the CD28 response complex <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>, other work has not supported this conclusion.
Recent studies suggest that the <a href="output.html#77">CD28 response element</a> (<a href="output.html#77">CD28RE</a>) does not function independently but works instead in conjunction with the adjacent promoter proximal <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1-<a href="output.html#40">binding site</a> and this hypothesis is confirmed here.
Also in the current study, <a href="output.html#63">binding activity</a> to the <a href="output.html#77">CD28RE</a>/<a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 sequence of the <a href="output.html#119">IL-2 promoter</a> is evaluated.
Although four specific complexes can be detected binding to this sequence, only one of these complexes is specific for both the <a href="output.html#77">CD28RE</a> and the adjacent <a href="output.html#269">AP-1 site</a>.
Of the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>/Rel <a href="output.html#164">family members</a> tested, this <a href="output.html#77">CD28RE</a>/<a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1-specific complex contains predominantly c-Rel, despite the fact that both p50 and RelA can efficiently bind to the <a href="output.html#77">CD28RE</a>.
c-Fos and c-Jun are also found in this <a href="output.html#77">CD28RE</a>/<a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1-specific complex.
These data indicate that functional complexes encompassing both the <a href="output.html#77">CD28RE</a> and the <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1-<a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a> influence <a href="output.html#119">IL-2 promoter</a> activity in CD28-costimulated T cells.

<a href="output.html#66">Transcriptional regulation</a> during myelopoiesis.

The coordinated production of all <a href="output.html#146">blood cells</a> from a common stem cell is a highly regulated process involving successive stages of commitment and differentiation.
From analyses of mice deficient in <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> genes and from the characterizations of chromosome breakpoints in <a href="output.html#165">human leukemias</a>, it has become evident that <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> are important regulators of hematopoiesis.
During myelopoiesis, which includes the development of granulocytic and monocytic lineages, <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> from several families are active, including AML1/<a href="output.html#69">CBF beta</a>, C/EBP, Ets, c-Myb, HOX, and MZF-1.
Few of these factors are expressed exclusively in <a href="output.html#161">myeloid cells</a>; instead it appears that they cooperatively regulate transcription of myeloid-specific genes.
Here we discuss recent advances in <a href="output.html#66">transcriptional regulation</a> during myelopoiesis.

Rel/<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> transcription factors and the control of apoptosis.

The process of apoptosis is used to eliminate unwanted cells from a wide variety of organisms.
Various extracellular signals, often converging in common intracellular pathways, can induce apoptosis in a cell-type-specific fashion.
Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated that Rel/<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> transcription factors regulate apoptosis in many <a href="output.html#148">cell types</a>.
In most cells, Rel/<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> transcription factors appear to mediate survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis; however, under some circumstances, activation of these factors may also promote apoptosis.

Four <a href="output.html#120">P-like elements</a> are required for optimal transcription of the mouse <a href="output.html#264">IL-4 gene</a>: involvement of a distinct set of <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> of activated T cells and <a href="output.html#24">activator protein-1</a> <a href="output.html#95">family proteins</a>.

We previously identified the P sequence as a critical <a href="output.html#58">regulatory element</a> of the human <a href="output.html#215">IL-4 promoter</a>.
In the mouse <a href="output.html#215">IL-4 promoter</a>, there are five elements homologous to the human P sequence designated conserved lymphokine element 0 (CLE0), P, P2, P3 and P4.
To characterize the role of these <a href="output.html#120">P-like elements</a> and their <a href="output.html#17">binding factors</a> in the native promoter, we did <a href="output.html#223">transient transfection</a> and <a href="output.html#14">electrophoretic mobility shift assays</a> (<a href="output.html#14">EMSA</a>).
Transfection of EL-4 cells with the <a href="output.html#215">IL-4 promoter</a>-reporter constructs carrying mutated <a href="output.html#120">P-like elements</a> showed that four <a href="output.html#120">P-like elements</a>, CLE0, P, P2 and P4, but not P3, were required for optimal activation of the <a href="output.html#215">IL-4 promoter</a>.
<a href="output.html#14">EMSA</a> showed that both constitutive and inducible complexes bound to CLE0, P, P2 and P4, whereas only a constitutive complex bound to P3.
In competition and antibody supershift assays in <a href="output.html#14">EMSA</a>, complexes formed with P or P2 proved to contain <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> of activated T cells (NFAT) <a href="output.html#95">family proteins</a> as major components.
<a href="output.html#24">Activator protein</a> (<a href="output.html#24">AP</a>)-1 <a href="output.html#95">family proteins</a> interacted with CLE0, P, P2 and P4.
NFAT/<a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 complex formed only with P and P2.
Cross-competition assays among the <a href="output.html#120">P-like elements</a> revealed element-specific and common complexes.
Six tandem repeats of the <a href="output.html#115">P element</a> linked to the SV40 promoter responded to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, while that of other elements did not. It would thus appear that components of each P-like element-binding complexes are not identical and may coordinately contribute to <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activity</a>.

<a href="output.html#219">NF-AT activation</a> induced by a CAML-interacting member of the <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a> receptor superfamily.

Activation of the <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> of activated T cells <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> (NF-AT) is a key event underlying lymphocyte action.
The CAML (calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand) protein is a coinducer of <a href="output.html#219">NF-AT activation</a> when overexpressed in <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat T cells</a>.
A member of the <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a> receptor superfamily was isolated by virtue of its affinity for CAML.
Cross-linking of this lymphocyte-specific protein, designated TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor), on the surface of transfected <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a> with TACI-specific antibodies led to activation of the <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> NF-AT, <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1, and NFkappaB.
TACI-induced <a href="output.html#219">activation of NF-AT</a> was specifically blocked by a dominant-negative CAML mutant, thus implicating CAML as a signaling intermediate.

<a href="output.html#177">Phospholipase C gamma</a> 1 overexpression and activation induced by interferon beta in <a href="output.html#43">human T lymphocytes</a>: an ISGF3-independent response.

Interferons exert their antiviral, antiproliferative and immunoregulatory activities by stimulating the expression of several genes.
Such genes disclose a common element within their promoters, defined Interferon Stimulated <a href="output.html#64">Response Element</a> (ISRE), which binds a <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a>(s) translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (ISGF3) after the binding of interferon (IFN) to the specific receptor.
Here we report the induction of the synthesis and of the <a href="output.html#277">hydrolytic activity</a> of <a href="output.html#177">phospholipase C gamma</a> 1 (<a href="output.html#166">PLC gamma</a> 1) in <a href="output.html#43">human T lymphocytes</a> by IFN-beta.
The increased level of <a href="output.html#166">PLC gamma</a> 1 becomes evident after 90 min of IFN-beta treatment and is still detectable after 24 h.
Neither the <a href="output.html#166">PLC gamma</a> 1 overexpression induced by IFN nor the increased <a href="output.html#277">hydrolytic activity</a> of the enzyme appear to be affected by pretreatment of the cells with the <a href="output.html#21">protein tyrosine kinase</a> inhibitor genistein, which is known to prevent the association of ISGF3 components.
These results suggest that in <a href="output.html#43">human T lymphocytes</a> IFN-beta can activate other <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a>(s) distinct from ISGF3 to regulate <a href="output.html#166">PLC gamma</a> 1 expression.
In addition, the ability of this enzyme to hydrolyse PIP2, also in the presence of genistein, implies the possibility that this enzyme can exert its <a href="output.html#277">hydrolytic activity</a> independently of <a href="output.html#71">protein tyrosine kinase activation</a>.

Blockade of <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a> by dithiocarbamates involves novel mechanisms of inhibition of <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> of activated T cells.

Dithiocarbamates (DTCs) have recently been reported as powerful inhibitors of <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappaB activation</a> in a number of <a href="output.html#148">cell types</a>.
Given the role of this <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> in the <a href="output.html#181">regulation of gene expression</a> in the <a href="output.html#225">inflammatory response</a>, <a href="output.html#188">NF-kappaB inhibitors</a> have been suggested as potential therapeutic drugs for inflammatory diseases.
We show here that DTCs inhibited both interleukin 2 (IL-2) synthesis and membrane expression of antigens which are induced during <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a>.
This inhibition, which occurred with a parallel activation of c-Jun transactivating functions and expression, was reflected by transfection experiments at the <a href="output.html#119">IL-2 promoter</a> level, and involved not only the inhibition of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>-driven reporter activation but also that of <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> of activated T cells (NFAT).
Accordingly, <a href="output.html#14">electrophoretic mobility shift assays</a> (<a href="output.html#14">EMSAs</a>) indicated that <a href="output.html#167">pyrrolidine DTC</a> (<a href="output.html#167">PDTC</a>) prevented <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>, and NFAT <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a> in T cells stimulated with either <a href="output.html#22">phorbol myristate acetate</a> plus ionophore or antibodies against the CD3-T-<a href="output.html#109">cell receptor</a> complex and simultaneously activated the binding of <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1.
Furthermore, <a href="output.html#167">PDTC</a> differentially targeted both NFATp and NFATc <a href="output.html#164">family members</a>, inhibiting the transactivation functions of NFATp and mRNA induction of NFATc.
Strikingly, Western blotting and immunocytochemical experiments indicated that <a href="output.html#167">PDTC</a> promoted a transient and rapid shuttling of NFATp and NFATc, leading to their accelerated export from the nucleus of activated T cells.
We propose that the activation of an NFAT kinase by <a href="output.html#167">PDTC</a> could be responsible for the rapid shuttling of the NFAT, therefore transiently converting the sustained transactivation of this <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> that occurs during <a href="output.html#163">lymphocyte activation</a>, and show that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) can act by directly phosphorylating NFATp.
In addition, the combined inhibitory effects on NFAT and NF-KB support a potential use of DTCs as immunosuppressants.

Dysregulation of monocytic <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor-kappa B</a> by oxidized low-density lipoprotein.

<a href="output.html#3">Nuclear factor-kappa B</a> (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>)/Rel <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> may be involved in atherosclerosis, as is suggested by the presence of activated <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> in human atherosclerotic lesions.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) on the <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> system in human THP-1 <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a> as well as adherent monocytes.
Our results demonstrate that short-term incubation of these cells with oxLDL activated p50/p65 containing <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> dimers and induced the expression of the target gene IL-8.
This <a href="output.html#6">activation of NF-kappa B</a> was inhibited by the antioxidant and H2O2 scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor PSI.
The oxLDL-induced <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappa B activation</a> was accompanied by an initial depletion of I <a href="output.html#53">kappa B</a>-alpha followed by a slight transient increase in the level of this <a href="output.html#101">inhibitor protein</a>.
In contrast, long-term treatment with oxLDL prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced depletion of I <a href="output.html#53">kappa B</a>-alpha, accompanied by an inhibition of both <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappa B activation</a> and the expression of <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a>-alpha and interleukin-1 beta genes.
These observations provide additional evidence that oxLDL is a potent modulator of <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> and suggest that (dys)regulation of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>/Rel is likely to play an important role in atherogenesis.

Regulation of Id3 <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a> function by Cdk-2-dependent phosphorylation.

The functions of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> in activating differentiation-linked <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> and in inducing G1 <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a> arrest are negatively regulated by members of the Id family of HLH proteins.
These bHLH antagonists are induced during a mitogenic signalling response, and they function by sequestering their bHLH targets in inactive heterodimers that are unable to bind to specific gene regulatory (E box) sequences.
Recently, cyclin E-Cdk2- and cyclin A-Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of a single conserved serine residue (Ser5) in Id2 has been shown to occur during late G1-to-S phase transition of the <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a>, and this neutralizes the function of Id2 in abrogating E-box-dependent bHLH homo -or <a href="output.html#296">heterodimer complex formation</a> in vitro (E.Hara, M.Hall, and G.Peters, EMBO J.16:332-342, 1997).
We now show that an analogous cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Id3 alters the specificity of Id3 for abrogating both E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or <a href="output.html#296">heterodimer complex formation</a> in vitro and E-box-dependent <a href="output.html#172">reporter gene</a> function in vivo.
Furthermore, compared with wild-type Id3, an Id3 Asp5 mutant (mimicking phosphorylation) is unable to promote <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a> S phase entry in transfected fibroblasts, whereas an Id3 Ala5 mutant (ablating phosphorylation) displays an activity significantly greater than that of wild-type Id3 protein.
Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation therefore provides a switch during late G1-to-S phase that both nullifies an early G1 <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a> regulatory function of Id3 and modulates its target bHLH specificity.
These data also demonstrate that the ability of Id3 to promote <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a> S phase entry is not simply a function of its ability to modulate bHLH heterodimer-dependent <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> and establish a biologically important mechanism through which Cdk2 and Id-bHLH functions are integrated in the coordination of <a href="output.html#251">cell proliferation</a> and differentiation.

<a href="output.html#32">Estrogen receptor</a> diminishes DNA-binding activities of chicken GATA-1 and CACCC-<a href="output.html#168">binding proteins</a>.

In this study, we investigated the effect of <a href="output.html#32">ER</a> alpha (referred to throughout as <a href="output.html#32">ER</a>) on DNA-binding activities of <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> involved in regulating the <a href="output.html#87">expression of erythroid-specific genes</a>, and, in particular, the histone H5 gene.
Using <a href="output.html#14">electrophoretic mobility shift assays</a>, we found that in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, human <a href="output.html#32">ER</a> reduced the binding activities of chicken immature erythrocyte nuclear extracted proteins to GATA and CACCC sites in the H5 promoter and enhancer.
In contrast, the binding activities of NF1 and Sp1 were not affected by <a href="output.html#32">ER</a>.
Binding of <a href="output.html#32">ER</a> to an estrogen <a href="output.html#64">response element</a> was enhanced by addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate.
This lysate was also necessary for <a href="output.html#32">ER</a> to diminish the <a href="output.html#42">DNA-binding activity</a> of GATA-1.
These results suggest that additional factor(s) are necessary for full <a href="output.html#32">ER</a> function.
Both GATA-1 and CACCC-<a href="output.html#168">binding proteins</a> are critical for the developmentally regulated <a href="output.html#87">expression of erythroid-specific genes</a>.
We hypothesize that interference in DNA-binding activities of GATA-1 and CACCC-<a href="output.html#168">binding proteins</a> is the mechanism by which the <a href="output.html#32">ER</a> inhibits regulation of these genes.

Constitutive expression c-fos, c-jun, and <a href="output.html#3">NF kappa B</a> mRNA is in nucleated <a href="output.html#190">fetal blood cells</a> and up-regulation of c-fos and c-jun with <a href="output.html#279">anti-CD3 stimulation</a>.

Fetal and neonatal lymphocytes are relatively resistant to activation and <a href="output.html#220">cytokine production</a> when stimulated either via their T-cell antigen receptors or lectins.
The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for this phenomenon have not been clearly elucidated.
We have hypothesized that such defects in fetal/neonatal <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a> may be due to lack of expression of the transcriptional <a href="output.html#58">regulatory elements</a> required for <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a>.
We used reverse transcriptase-<a href="output.html#128">polymerase chain reaction</a> to examine both fetal and term neonatal cord bloods for mRNA expression of three <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> implicated in <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a>: c-jun, c-fos, and <a href="output.html#3">NF kappa B</a> (p50 subunit).
We demonstrate that mRNAs for all three of these regulatory factors are expressed in <a href="output.html#190">fetal blood cells</a> by the 27th week of gestation and in term cord bloods.
Activation of term infant cord blood mononuclear cells with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies resulted in up-regulation of both c-jun and c-fos mRNAs within 15 min of stimulation.
However, secretion of IL-2 by anti-CD3-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells was still blunted compared with control cells from adults.
We conclude that fetal nucleated <a href="output.html#146">blood cells</a> constitutively express important genes for cytokine regulation and are able to increase intracellular accumulation of the mRNAs for these factors in response to <a href="output.html#279">anti-CD3 stimulation</a>.
Thus, qualitative differences in the capacity to regulate these factors could not be shown in <a href="output.html#190">fetal blood cells</a>.
Quantitative experiments comparing binding of these <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> to the <a href="output.html#119">IL-2 promoter</a> are currently under investigation.

<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>/Rel <a href="output.html#164">family members</a> regulating the <a href="output.html#28">ICAM-1</a> promoter in <a href="output.html#88">monocytic THP-1 cells</a>.

A <a href="output.html#53">kappa B</a>-site was identified in the promoter of the <a href="output.html#28">intercellular adhesion molecule-1</a> (<a href="output.html#28">ICAM-1</a>) gene, which is involved in regulation of <a href="output.html#28">ICAM-1</a> expression by <a href="output.html#1">tumor necrosis factor alpha</a> (<a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>) and glucocorticoids.
We now report on the <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> which bind and transactivate this enhancer sequence.
In vitro, the <a href="output.html#243">ICAM-1 kappa B</a> site appeared to bind RelA and c-Rel homodimers as well as heterodimers with <a href="output.html#228">NF-kappa B1</a>, but weakly <a href="output.html#228">NF-kappa B1</a> homodimers.
In addition, both RelA and c-Rel, but not <a href="output.html#228">NF-kappa B1</a>, were shown to transactivate an <a href="output.html#243">ICAM-1 kappa B</a>-reporter construct.
In <a href="output.html#88">monocytic THP-1 cells</a> <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> induced two <a href="output.html#157">nuclear complexes</a> which in vitro bound to the <a href="output.html#243">ICAM-1 kappa B</a> site.
Using antibodies in an electrophoretic mobility <a href="output.html#273">supershift assay</a>, one of these complexes was shown to contain <a href="output.html#228">NF-kappa B1</a> and RelA, and to <a href="output.html#280">bind with higher affinity</a> to the consensus <a href="output.html#53">kappa B</a> site in the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a> long terminal repeat.
The second complex contained RelA, and exhibited higher affinity towards the <a href="output.html#243">ICAM-1 kappa B</a> than to the <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a> <a href="output.html#53">kappa B</a> site.
The <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptor</a> was shown to repress activity of both the RelA homodimer and the <a href="output.html#228">NF-kappa B1</a>/RelA heterodimer.
We argue that in vivo RelA homodimers are likely to play a dominant role in <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>-induced <a href="output.html#28">ICAM-1</a> transcription in <a href="output.html#25">monocytic cells</a>.

<a href="output.html#281">LPS tolerance</a> in monocytes/macrophages: three 3' cytosins are required in the <a href="output.html#191">DNA binding motif</a> for detection of upregulated <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> <a href="output.html#254">p50 homodimers</a>.

When monocytes are stimulated with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) repeatedly then the initially high expression of the <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a> (<a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a>) gene is only very low, i.e. the cells are tolerant to LPS.
<a href="output.html#229">Tolerant cells</a> still express the CD14 receptor and they can still be activated to mobilize <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> into nucleus.
Analysis of the <a href="output.html#168">binding proteins</a> employing the -605 motif of the human <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a> promoter (GGGGCTGTCCC) revealed that in <a href="output.html#229">tolerant cells</a> of the human monocytic <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> Mono Mac 6 there is a predominance of p50p50 of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a>.
We now show that a mutant motif that exchanges the terminal 3' C for a G fails to bind the <a href="output.html#254">p50 homodimer</a> that is upregulated in LPS toler ant human Mono Mac 6 cells.
The same is true for <a href="output.html#54">nuclear extracts</a> taken from the murine P388D1 macrophage <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> when tested with the -516 motif of the murine <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a> promoter (GGGGGCTTTCCC).
Here the wild type motif gives efficient binding of p50p50 that again is upregulated in <a href="output.html#229">tolerant cells</a> whereas a mutant with a 3' G shows hardly any binding of p50p50.
Conversely, the murine <a href="output.html#186">kappa light chain</a> enhancer motif (GGGGACTTTCCG) does not efficiently bind the nuclear p50p50 from tolerant murine P388 macrophages.
Binding is, however, readily detected when the 3' G is replaced by a C.
These data show that the detection of upregulated <a href="output.html#254">p50 homodimers</a> in LPS <a href="output.html#229">tolerant cells</a> is dependent on subtle differences in the sequence of the <a href="output.html#191">DNA binding motif</a>.

We measured the number of <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptors</a> (<a href="output.html#7">GR</a>) in <a href="output.html#192">cord blood lymphocytes</a> and the <a href="output.html#280">binding affinity</a> (Kd) in 15 term and in 20 preterm babies.
Thirteen preterms of the latter group received prenatal steroid treatment.
Seven preterms developed <a href="output.html#72">neonatal respiratory distress syndrome</a> (<a href="output.html#72">NRDS</a>).
The number of <a href="output.html#7">GR</a> and the Kd were similar in the term and preterm (with and without <a href="output.html#72">NRDS</a>) babies.
The maximum (3H)-thymidine incorporation into DNA of <a href="output.html#192">cord blood lymphocytes</a> from all preterms, with or without <a href="output.html#72">NRDS</a> was suppressed when compared to that from term babies or adults.
This could partly be explained by the antenatal steroid treatment.
Sensitivity (ID50) of the lymphocytes for the <a href="output.html#159">inhibitory effect</a> of dexamethasone was the same in all groups.
In this study on the number and function of <a href="output.html#197">GR in lymphocytes</a>, we were unable to find a relation between the functionality of the <a href="output.html#7">GR</a> and the development of <a href="output.html#72">NRDS</a>.

<a href="output.html#98">Human immunodeficiency virus type</a> 1 long terminal repeat quasispecies differ in basal transcription and <a href="output.html#33">nuclear factor</a> recruitment in human glial cells and lymphocytes.

The generation of genomic diversity during the course of infection has the potential to affect all aspects of <a href="output.html#142">HIV-1 replication</a>, including expression of the proviral genome.
To gain a better understanding of the impact of long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence diversity on LTR-directed <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> in cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and <a href="output.html#121">immune system</a>, we amplified and cloned LTRs from proviral DNA in <a href="output.html#18">HIV</a>-1-infected <a href="output.html#19">peripheral blood</a>.
Sequence analysis of nineteen LTRs cloned from 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients revealed an average of 33 nucleotide changes (with respect to the sequence of the <a href="output.html#230">LAI LTR</a>) within the 455-bp U3 region.
<a href="output.html#141">Transient expression</a> analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs had activities which varied significantly from the <a href="output.html#230">LAI LTR</a> in U-373 MG cells (an astrocytoma <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a>) as well as in <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a> (a CD4-positive lymphocyte <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a>).
While LTRs which demonstrated the highest activities in U-373 MG cells also yielded high activities in <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a>, the LTRs were generally more active in <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a> when compared to the <a href="output.html#230">LAI LTR</a>.
Differences in <a href="output.html#282">LTR sequence</a> also resulted in differences in <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> recruitment to cis-acting sites within the U3 region of the LTR, as demonstrated by <a href="output.html#14">electrophoretic mobility shift assays</a>.
In particular, naturally occurring sequence variation impacted <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> binding to an <a href="output.html#11">activating transcription</a> factor/cAMP <a href="output.html#64">response element</a> binding (ATF/CREB) <a href="output.html#40">binding site</a> (located between the LEF-1 and distal <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a>) that we identified in previous studies of the <a href="output.html#272">HIV-1 LTR</a>.
These findings suggest that <a href="output.html#282">LTR sequence</a> changes can significantly affect basal LTR function and <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> recruitment, which may, in turn, alter the course of viral replication in cells of CNS and <a href="output.html#121">immune system</a> origin.

Stimulation of B and T cells activates <a href="output.html#283">expression of transcription</a> and differentiation factors.

During B and T <a href="output.html#92">cell differentiation</a> and proliferation many genes are induced or repressed while certain genes are constitutively expressed.
To investigate processes related to B and T <a href="output.html#29">cell activation</a>, the <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> of stimulated and nonstimulated Ramos and <a href="output.html#49">Jurkat cells</a> was studied using cDNA microarray technology.
Simultaneous analysis of close to 600 genes indicated highest increase in the <a href="output.html#283">expression of certain transcription</a>, differentiation and proliferation factors.
Many of these genes have not previously been shown to funcion in the stimulated lymphocytes.
Also genes encoding proteins involved in DNA replication, binding, transcription and translation were induced.
Large part of the activated genes were under very stringent regulation being expressed only after stimulation.
The mechanism and function of the expressed genes during lymphocyte differentiation and in disorders is discussed.

<a href="output.html#41">Retinoid X receptor</a> and c-cerbA/thyroid hormone receptor regulate erythroid cell growth and differentiation.

Nuclear receptors are important regulators of <a href="output.html#193">erythroid cell development</a>.
Here we investigated the impact of <a href="output.html#41">retinoid X receptor</a> (<a href="output.html#41">RXR</a>), <a href="output.html#30">retinoic acid receptor</a> (<a href="output.html#30">RAR</a>), and of the c-erbA/thyroid hormone (T3) receptor (c-erbA/TR) on growth and differentiation of <a href="output.html#35">erythroid cells</a> using an in vitro culture system of stem cell factor-dependent erythroid progenitors.
<a href="output.html#41">RXR</a>, <a href="output.html#30">RAR</a>, and c-erbA/TR-specific ligands were found to induce <a href="output.html#87">erythroid-specific gene expression</a> and to accelerate <a href="output.html#278">erythroid differentiation</a> in culture, with T3 being most effective.
Furthermore, while ligand-activated c-erbA/TR accelerated differentiation, unliganded c-erbA/TR effectively blocked differentiation and supported sustained progenitor growth in culture.
Thus, c-erbA/TR appears to act as a binary switch affecting erythroid cell fate: unliganded c-erbA/TR supports growth while ligand-activated c-erbA/TR induces differentiation.
Additionally, to determine the impact of <a href="output.html#41">RXR</a> for <a href="output.html#193">erythroid cell development</a>, dominant interfering mutant RXRs, lacking the <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activator</a> functions AF-1 and AF-2, or AF-2 only, or the entire DNA-binding domain, were introduced into erythroid progenitor cells via recombinant retrovirus vectors and analyzed for <a href="output.html#41">RXR</a>-specific effects.
It was found that expression of wild-type <a href="output.html#41">RXR</a> and of the <a href="output.html#41">RXR</a> mutants devoid of AF-1 and/or AF-2 supported a transient outgrowth of <a href="output.html#35">erythroid cells</a>.
In marked contrast, expression of the dominant interfering deltaDNA-binding domain <a href="output.html#41">RXR</a>, containing a deletion of the entire DNA-binding domain, was incompatible with erythroid cell growth in vitro, suggesting a pivotal role of <a href="output.html#41">RXR</a> for <a href="output.html#193">erythroid cell development</a>.

The <a href="output.html#50">Epstein-Barr virus</a> Rta protein activates <a href="output.html#194">lytic cycle genes</a> and can disrupt latency in <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a>.

The transition of <a href="output.html#50">Epstein-Barr virus</a> (<a href="output.html#50">EBV</a>) from latency into the <a href="output.html#82">lytic cycle</a> is associated with the expression of two immediate-early viral genes, BZLF1 and BRLF1.
Overexpression of ZEBRA, the product of BZLF1, is sufficient to disrupt latency in <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a> and <a href="output.html#102">epithelial cells</a> by stimulating expression of <a href="output.html#194">lytic cycle genes</a>, including BRLF1.
The BRLF1 product Rta functions as a <a href="output.html#11">transcriptional activator</a> in both <a href="output.html#59">B lymphocytes</a> and <a href="output.html#102">epithelial cells</a>.
However, Rta has recently been reported to disrupt latency in an epithelial specific manner (S. Zalani, E. Holley-Guthrie, and S. Kenney, Proc. <a href="output.html#300">Natl. Acad</a>. Sci. USA 93:9194-9199, 1996).
Here we demonstrate that expression of Rta is also sufficient for disruption of latency in a permissive B-<a href="output.html#15">cell line</a>.
In HH514-16 cells, transfection of Rta leads to synthesis of ZEBRA, viral DNA replication, and late <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a>.
However, Rta by itself is less potent than ZEBRA in the ability to activate most early and late <a href="output.html#194">lytic cycle genes</a>.
In light of previous work implicating ZEBRA in the activation of Rta, we suggest a cooperative model for <a href="output.html#50">EBV</a> entry into the <a href="output.html#82">lytic cycle</a>.
Expression of either BZLF1 or BRLF1 triggers expression of the other immediate-early factor, and together these activators act individually or in synergy on downstream targets to activate the viral <a href="output.html#82">lytic cycle</a>.

Position effect of translocations involving the inactive X chromosome: <a href="output.html#214">physical linkage</a> to XIC/XIST does not lead to long-range de novo inactivation in human <a href="output.html#92">differentiated cells</a>.

Given the reported long-range cis-inactivating effect of the XIST gene in early embryonic development and the lack of requirement of X-chromosome-specific elements for propagating the inactive state, there exists the possibility of cis inactivation of autosomal material after de novo translocation to an inactive X chromosome (Xi) in <a href="output.html#92">differentiated cells</a>.
We have analyzed de novo radiation-induced translocations between the Xi and autosomes to study the maintenance and spreading of X-chromosome inactivation (X inactivation) in relation to the position of the X-inactivation center (XIC)/XIST in <a href="output.html#92">differentiated cells</a>.
Autosome/Xi translocations were detected by <a href="output.html#195">fluorescence in situ hybridization</a> (<a href="output.html#195">FISH</a>).
The activation status of the chromosomes involved in the translocation was determined by simultaneous immunocytogenetic studies using antibodies against either BrdU incorporated at late S phase or acetylated histone H4.
The position of XIC/XIST in the reciprocal products of the translocation was determined by XIST-specific <a href="output.html#195">FISH</a> and computer enhancement.
In other experiments, the Xq13 region carrying XIC/XIST was localized by computer enhancement of the DAPI banding pattern.
Our study in <a href="output.html#92">differentiated cells</a> provides a visual demonstration that physical separation from XIC/XIST does not result in reactivation of inactive X-chromosome material and that X inactivation is not spread to the translocated autosomes irrespective of the position of XIC/XIST.
This observation suggests that <a href="output.html#214">physical linkage</a> to XIC/XIST does not lead to de novo inactivation of autosomal material.

Differential regulation of <a href="output.html#99">coproporphyrinogen oxidase</a> gene between erythroid and <a href="output.html#154">nonerythroid cells</a>.

<a href="output.html#99">Coproporphyrinogen oxidase</a> (<a href="output.html#99">CPO</a>) catalyzes the sixth step of the heme biosynthetic pathway.
To assess the tissue-specific regulation of the <a href="output.html#99">CPO</a> gene promoter, mouse genomic DNA clones for <a href="output.html#99">CPO</a> were isolated.
Structural analysis demonstrated that the mouse <a href="output.html#99">CPO</a> gene spans approximately 11 kb and consists of seven exons, just like its human counterpart.
Functional analysis of the promoter by <a href="output.html#223">transient transfection</a> assays indicated that synergistic action between an SP-1-like element at -21/-12, a GATA site at -59/-54, and a novel <a href="output.html#58">regulatory element</a>, CPRE (-GGACTACAG-) at -49/-41, is essential for the <a href="output.html#83">promoter activity</a> in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells.
In nonerythroid NIH3T3 cells, however, the GATA site is not required.
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that specific DNA-protein complexes can be formed with each element, and that there are cell-specific differences in factors, which bind to the SP-1-like element between MEL and NIH3T3 cells.
These results provide evidence for differential regulation of the promoter function of <a href="output.html#99">CPO</a> gene between erythroid and <a href="output.html#154">nonerythroid cells</a>.

Inhibition of <a href="output.html#182">RNA polymerase II</a> transcription in <a href="output.html#9">human cells</a> by synthetic DNA-binding ligands [see comments]

Sequence-specific DNA-binding small molecules that can permeate <a href="output.html#9">human cells</a> potentially could regulate transcription of specific genes.
Multiple cellular DNA-binding <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> are required by <a href="output.html#98">HIV type</a> 1 for RNA synthesis.
Two pyrrole-imidazole polyamides were designed to bind <a href="output.html#284">DNA sequences</a> immediately adjacent to <a href="output.html#40">binding sites</a> for the <a href="output.html#4">transcription factors</a> Ets-1, lymphoid-enhancer binding factor 1, and TATA-box binding protein.
These synthetic ligands specifically inhibit DNA-binding of each <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> and <a href="output.html#98">HIV type</a> 1 transcription in cell-free assays.
When used in combination, the polyamides inhibit virus replication by >99% in isolated human <a href="output.html#45">peripheral blood lymphocytes</a>, with no detectable cell toxicity.
The ability of small molecules to target predetermined <a href="output.html#284">DNA sequences</a> located within <a href="output.html#182">RNA polymerase II</a> promoters suggests a general approach for <a href="output.html#181">regulation of gene expression</a>, as well as a mechanism for the inhibition of viral replication.

Mechanism of interleukin-10 inhibition of T-helper <a href="output.html#29">cell activation</a> by superantigen at the level of the <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a>.

We have analyzed the effects of interleukin-10 (IL-10) on the entry of quiescent CD4(+) T cells into the <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a> upon stimulation with the superantigen <a href="output.html#235">staphylococcal enterotoxin</a> B (SEB).
IL-10 arrested cells at G0/G1.
IL-10 treatment prevented the downregulation of p27(Kip1), an <a href="output.html#101">inhibitory protein</a> that controls progression out of the G0 phase of the <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a>.
IL-10 also prevented the upregulation of the G1 cyclins D2 and D3, proteins necessary for entry and progression through the G1 phase of the <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a>.
Associated with the inhibition of the <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a>, IL-10 suppressed SEB induction of interleukin-2 (IL-2).
Addition of exogenous IL-2 to IL-10-treated cells significantly reversed the antiproliferative effects of IL-10.
Moreover, IL-10 effects on the early G1 proteins p27(Kip1) and cyclin D2 were similarly reversed by exogenous IL-2.
Although this reversal by IL-2 was pronounced, it was not complete, suggesting that IL-10 may have some effects not directly related to the suppression of <a href="output.html#79">IL-2 production</a>.
Cell separation experiments suggest that IL-10 can effect purified CD4(+) T cells directly, providing functional evidence for the presence of IL-10 receptors on CD4(+) T cells.
IL-10 also inhibited <a href="output.html#160">expression of IL-2</a> transcriptional regulators c-fos and c-jun, which also inhibit other <a href="output.html#122">cell functions</a>.
Our studies show that the mechanism of IL-10 regulation of quiescent CD4(+) <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a> is mainly by blocking induction of IL-2 that is critical to downregulation of p27(Kip1) and upregulation of D cyclins in <a href="output.html#61">T-cell activation</a> and entry into the <a href="output.html#47">cell cycle</a>.

Effect of <a href="output.html#232">environmental estrogens</a> on <a href="output.html#136">IL-1beta promoter activity</a> in a macrophage <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a>.

<a href="output.html#232">Environmental estrogens</a> or estrogen disrupters have recently received a great deal of attention because of their potential health impact on reproductive tissues.
Few, if any, studies have been made on the impact of these compounds on the <a href="output.html#121">immune system</a>.
We sought to determine the activities of various <a href="output.html#232">environmental estrogens</a> on the modulation of the interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) gene in a model monocytic <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a>, hER + IL-1beta-<a href="output.html#81">CAT</a>+.
This <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> stably transfected with the human <a href="output.html#32">estrogen receptor</a>, and an <a href="output.html#301">IL-1beta promoter</a> construct fused to the <a href="output.html#171">CAT reporter</a> gene allows us to monitor the effect of estrogenic compounds on <a href="output.html#136">IL-1beta promoter activity</a>.
17beta-estradiol (E2) markedly enhanced lipopolysaccharide -(LPS) induced <a href="output.html#301">IL-1beta promoter</a>-driven <a href="output.html#81">CAT</a> activity in a <a href="output.html#231">dose-dependent manner</a>.
The mycotoxins alpha-zearalenol and zearalenone both exhibited full <a href="output.html#285">agonist activity</a>, but at lower potencies, with EC50 values of 1.8 and 54 nM, respectively, compared with E2 at 0.5 nM.
In addition, genistein was a very low-potency agonist, having an EC50 of 1.5 microM.
Similar to the E2 response, the slope factors for alpha-zearalenol, zearalenone, and genistein were close to 3.0, suggesting positive cooperativity in the estrogenic response.
The activity of the mycotoxins appeared to be mediated through the <a href="output.html#32">estrogen receptor</a>, since both the antiestrogens H1285 and ICI 182,780 effectively inhibited their <a href="output.html#285">agonist activity</a> in a <a href="output.html#231">dose-dependent manner</a>.
Representative environmental estrogenic compounds both from plant and industrial sources were also tested.
Unlike the mycoestrogens, none of the compounds, with the exception of genistein, synergized with LPS to enhance <a href="output.html#136">IL-1beta promoter activity</a>.
When tested for antiestrogenic activity, the industrial compound 4-octylphenol was able to antagonize the response to E2; however, the response was three orders of magnitude less potent than H 1285.
Naringenin, a plant flavonoid, showed little or no ability to antagonize the response to E2.
Overall, the results show that some <a href="output.html#232">environmental estrogens</a> that display <a href="output.html#285">agonist activity</a> in reproductive tissue also have an effect on IL-1 <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> in hemopoietic-derived tissue.

Functional testosterone receptors in plasma membranes of T cells.

T cells are considered to be unresponsive to testosterone due to the absence of <a href="output.html#38">androgen receptors</a> (<a href="output.html#38">AR</a>).
Here, we demonstrate the testosterone responsiveness of murine splenic T cells in vitro as well as the presence of unconventional <a href="output.html#80">cell surface</a> receptors for testosterone and classical intracellular <a href="output.html#38">AR</a>.
<a href="output.html#40">Binding sites</a> for testosterone on the surface of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets of T cells are directly revealed with the impeded ligand testosterone-BSA-FITC by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry, respectively.
Binding of the <a href="output.html#286">plasma membrane</a> impermeable testosterone-BSA conjugate induces a rapid rise (<5 s) in [Ca2+]i of Fura-2-loaded T cells.
This rise reflects influx of extracellular Ca2+ through non-voltage-gated and Ni2+-blockable Ca2+ channels of the <a href="output.html#286">plasma membrane</a>.
The testosterone-BSA-induced Ca2+ import is not affected by cyproterone, a blocker of the <a href="output.html#38">AR</a>.
In addition, <a href="output.html#38">AR</a> are not detectable on the <a href="output.html#80">surface of intact T cells</a> when using anti-<a href="output.html#38">AR</a> antibodies directed against the amino and carboxy terminus of the <a href="output.html#38">AR</a>, although T cells contain <a href="output.html#38">AR</a>, as revealed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and Western blotting.
<a href="output.html#38">AR</a> can be visualized with the anti-<a href="output.html#38">AR</a> antibodies in the cytoplasm of permeabilized T cells by using CLSM, though <a href="output.html#38">AR</a> are not detectable in cytosol fractions when using the charcoal binding assay with 3H-R1881 as ligand.
Cytoplasmic <a href="output.html#38">AR</a> do not translocate to the nucleus of T cells in the presence of testosterone, in contrast to cytoplasmic <a href="output.html#38">AR</a> in human cancer LNCaP cells.
These findings suggest that the classical <a href="output.html#38">AR</a> present in splenic T cells are not active in the genomic pathway.
By contrast, the <a href="output.html#80">cell surface</a> receptors for testosterone are in a functionally active state, enabling T cells a nongenomic response to testosterone.

Accessing <a href="output.html#50">Epstein-Barr virus</a>-specific T-cell memory with peptide-loaded dendritic cells.

The conventional means of studying <a href="output.html#50">Epstein-Barr virus</a> (<a href="output.html#50">EBV</a>)-induced <a href="output.html#67">cytotoxic T-lymphocyte</a> (<a href="output.html#67">CTL</a>) memory, by in vitro stimulation with the latently infected autologous lymphoblastoid <a href="output.html#15">cell line</a> (LCL), has important limitations.
First, it gives no information on memory to <a href="output.html#82">lytic cycle</a> antigens; second, it preferentially amplifies the dominant components of latent antigen-specific memory at the expense of key subdominant reactivities.
Here we describe an alternative approach, based on in vitro stimulation with epitope peptide-loaded dendritic cells (DCs), which allows one to probe the <a href="output.html#67">CTL</a> repertoire for any individual reactivity of choice; this method proved significantly more efficient than stimulation with peptide alone.
Using this approach we first show that reactivities to the immunodominant and subdominant <a href="output.html#82">lytic cycle</a> epitopes identified by T cells during primary <a href="output.html#50">EBV</a> infection are regularly detectable in the <a href="output.html#67">CTL</a> memory of virus carriers; this implies that in such carriers chronic virus replication remains under direct T-cell control.
We further show that subdominant latent cycle reactivities to epitopes in the latent membrane protein LMP2, though rarely undetectable in LCL-stimulated populations, can be reactivated by DC stimulation and selectively expanded as polyclonal <a href="output.html#67">CTL</a> lines; the adoptive transfer of such preparations may be of value in targeting certain <a href="output.html#50">EBV</a>-positive malignancies.

Inhibition of <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappa B activation</a> in vitro and in vivo: role of 26S proteasome.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> plays a critical role in regulating the <a href="output.html#225">inflammatory response</a>.
Data obtained from studies in our laboratories demonstrate that the proteasome plays an important role in the inflammatory cascade by regulating the <a href="output.html#6">activation of NF-kappa B</a>.
Indeed, the availability of selective and orally active proteasome inhibitors should prove useful in delineating the roles of the proteasome and <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> in other pathophysiological conditions such as cancer and heart disease.

RFLAT-1: a new zinc finger <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> that activates RANTES <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> in T lymphocytes.

RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, <a href="output.html#199">Normal T cell</a> Expressed and Secreted) is a chemoattractant cytokine (chemokine) important in the generation of inflammatory infiltrate and <a href="output.html#18">human immunodeficiency virus</a> entry into immune cells.
RANTES is expressed late (3-5 days) after <a href="output.html#163">activation in T lymphocytes</a>.
Using expression cloning, we identified the first "late" T lymphocyte associated <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> and named it "RANTES Factor of Late Activated T Lymphocytes-1" (RFLAT-1).
RFLAT-1 is a novel, phosphorylated, zinc finger <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> that is expressed in T cells 3 days after activation, coincident with RANTES expression.
While <a href="output.html#153">Rel proteins</a> play the dominant role in RANTES <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> in fibroblasts, RFLAT-1 is a strong transactivator for RANTES in T cells.

Clonality of isolated eosinophils in the <a href="output.html#302">hypereosinophilic syndrome</a>.

The <a href="output.html#89">idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome</a> (<a href="output.html#89">IHES</a>) is a rare disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent eosinophilia associated with multiple organ dysfunction due to eosinophilic tissue infiltration.
In the absence of karyotypic abnormalities, there is no specific test to detect <a href="output.html#233">clonal eosinophilia</a> in <a href="output.html#89">IHES</a>.
Analysis of X-chromosome inactivation patterns can be used to determine whether proliferative disorders are clonal in origin.
Methylation of HpaII and Hha I sites near the polymorphic trinucleotide repeat of the human <a href="output.html#175">androgen receptor gene</a> (HUMARA) has been shown to correlate with X-inactivation.
In this study, we have used the <a href="output.html#128">polymerase chain reaction</a> (<a href="output.html#128">PCR</a>) with nested primers to analyze <a href="output.html#287">X-inactivation patterns</a> of the HUMARA loci in purified eosinophils from female patients with eosinophilia.
<a href="output.html#19">Peripheral blood</a> eosinophils were isolated by their autofluoresence using flow cytometric sorting.
Eosinophils purified from a female patient presenting with <a href="output.html#89">IHES</a> were found to show a clonal pattern of X-inactivation.
Eosinophil-depleted leukocytes from this patient were polyclonal by HUMARA analysis, thus excluding skewedness of random X-inactivation.
After corticosteroid suppression of her blood eosinophilia, a clonal population of eosinophils could no longer be detected in purified eosinophils.
In contrast, eosinophils purified from a patient with Churg-Strauss syndrome and from six patients with reactive eosinophilias attributed to allergy, parasitic infection, or drug reaction showed a polyclonal pattern of X-inactivation by HUMARA analysis.
The finding of <a href="output.html#233">clonal eosinophilia</a> in a patient presenting with <a href="output.html#89">IHES</a> indicates that such patients may have, in reality, a low-grade clonal disorder that can be distinguished from reactive eosinophilias by HUMARA analysis.
Further, the method described can be used to monitor disease progression.

Interferon-alpha activates multiple <a href="output.html#114">STAT proteins</a> and upregulates proliferation-associated IL-2Ralpha, c-myc, and pim-1 genes in <a href="output.html#9">human T cells</a>.

Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunoregulatory functions.
There is increasing evidence that IFN-alpha has an important role in T-cell biology.
We have analyzed the <a href="output.html#160">expression of IL-2</a>Ralpha, c-myc, and pim-1 genes in anti-CD3-activated <a href="output.html#43">human T lymphocytes</a>.
The induction of these genes is associated with interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced T-<a href="output.html#251">cell proliferation</a>.
Treatment of T lymphocytes with IFN-alpha, IL-2, IL-12, and IL-15 upregulated IL-2Ralpha, c-myc, and pim-1 <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a>.
IFN-alpha also sensitized T cells to IL-2-induced proliferation, further suggesting that IFN-alpha may be involved in the regulation of T-cell mitogenesis.
When we analyzed the nature of <a href="output.html#114">STAT proteins</a> capable of binding to IL-2Ralpha, pim-1, and IRF-1 GAS elements after cytokine stimulation, we observed IFN-alpha-induced binding of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4, but not STAT5 to all of these elements.
Yet, IFN-alpha was able to activate binding of STAT5 to the high-affinity IFP53 GAS site.
IFN-alpha enhanced <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, and STAT5b.
IL-12 induced STAT4 and IL-2 and IL-15 induced STAT5 binding to the GAS elements.
Taken together, our results suggest that IFN-alpha, IL-2, IL-12, and IL-15 have overlapping <a href="output.html#187">activities on human T cells</a>.
These findings thus emphasize the importance of IFN-alpha as a T-cell regulatory cytokine.

N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibits primary human T <a href="output.html#97">cell responses</a> at the <a href="output.html#288">dendritic cell</a> level: association with <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> inhibition.

N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant molecule endowed with immunomodulatory properties.
To investigate the effect of NAC on the induction phase of T <a href="output.html#97">cell responses</a>, we analyzed its action on human dendritic cells (DC) derived from adherent PBMC cultured with IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF.
We first found that NAC inhibited the constitutive as well as the <a href="output.html#123">LPS-induced activity</a> of the <a href="output.html#96">transcription factor NF-kappaB</a>.
In parallel, NAC was shown to down-regulate the <a href="output.html#220">production of cytokines</a> by DC as well as their <a href="output.html#110">surface expression</a> of HLA-DR, CD86 (B7-2), and CD40 molecules both at the basal state and upon LPS activation.
NAC also inhibited DC responses induced by CD40 engagement.
The inhibitory effects of NAC were not due to nonspecific toxicity as neither the viability of DC nor their mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis were modified by NAC.
Finally, we found that the addition of NAC to MLR between naive T cells and allogeneic DC resulted in a profound inhibition of alloreactive responses, which could be attributed to a defect of DC as APC-independent T <a href="output.html#97">cell responses</a> were not inhibited by NAC.
Altogether, our results suggest that NAC might impair the generation of primary <a href="output.html#151">immune responses</a> in humans through its inhibitory action on DC.

Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 expression by 4-trifluoromethyl derivatives of salicylate, triflusal, and its deacetylated metabolite, 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid.

The therapeutic potential of drugs that block the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 has been emphasized.
When two 4-trifluoromethyl salicylate derivatives [2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid (triflusal) and its deacetylated metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (HTB)] were compared with aspirin and <a href="output.html#234">sodium salicylate</a> as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, we observed that in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-activated human blood, triflusal, aspirin, and HTB, but not <a href="output.html#234">sodium salicylate</a>, inhibited COX-2-mediated <a href="output.html#124">prostaglandin E2</a> (<a href="output.html#124">PGE2</a>) production (IC50 = 0.16, 0.18, 0.39, and >10 mM, respectively).
However, only triflusal and aspirin inhibited purified COX-2 enzyme.
To test this apparent discrepancy, we realized that HTB and triflusal (but neither aspirin nor salicylate) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of COX-2 protein expression in peripheral <a href="output.html#174">human mononuclear cells</a>.
This observation was further confirmed in a rat air pouch model in vivo, in which both aspirin and triflusal inhibited <a href="output.html#124">PGE2</a> production (ID50 = 18.9 and 11.4 mg/kg p.o., respectively) but only triflusal-treated animals showed a decrease in <a href="output.html#289">COX-2 expression</a>.
This different behavior may be, at least in part, due to the ability of HTB and triflusal to block the activation of the <a href="output.html#96">transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB</a> to a higher extent than aspirin and <a href="output.html#234">sodium salicylate</a>.
Thus, in addition to inhibiting the COX-2 activity at therapeutic concentrations, triflusal is able to block through its metabolite HTB the expression of new enzyme, and hence the resumption of <a href="output.html#124">PGE2</a> synthesis.
Triflusal and HTB may exert beneficial effects in processes in which de novo <a href="output.html#289">COX-2 expression</a> is involved and, in a broader sense, in pathological situations in which genes under <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor-kappaB</a> control are up-regulated.

[Corticoids and allergy]

Inflammation is constantly observed in allergic reactions.
Corticosteroids are most effective in preventing the late phase of allergic reaction.
The action of glucocorticosteroids is mediated through <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptors</a> present in the cellular cytoplasm.
When activated, <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptors</a> form a dimer and bind to DNA after migration into the nucleus.
Interaction to DNA induces changes in the transcription rate, leading to either <a href="output.html#125">gene induction</a> or gene repression.
<a href="output.html#7">Glucocorticoid receptors</a> are also able to interact with <a href="output.html#4">transcriptional factors</a> such as <a href="output.html#24">AP</a>-1 (<a href="output.html#24">activator protein-1</a>) of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappa B</a> (<a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor-kappa B</a>).
Through these actions glucocorticosteroids are susceptible to modify <a href="output.html#122">functions of cells</a> involved in the allergic <a href="output.html#225">inflammatory response</a>.
They are in particular able to inhibit most of the pro-inflammatory functions of the eosinophils.

<a href="output.html#56">LPS-Induced NF-kappaB activation</a> and <a href="output.html#36">TNF-alpha release in human monocytes</a> are <a href="output.html#21">protein tyrosine kinase</a> dependent and <a href="output.html#20">protein kinase C</a> independent.

BACKGROUND: <a href="output.html#1">Tumor necrosis factor alpha</a> (<a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>) is an important mediator of septic shock.
Endotoxin (LPS) <a href="output.html#31">signal transduction</a> in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a> leads to activation of <a href="output.html#3">nuclear factor-kappa B</a> (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>) and <a href="output.html#39">TNF-alpha release</a>.
Previous studies have implicated activation of both <a href="output.html#20">protein kinase C</a> (<a href="output.html#20">PKC</a>) and <a href="output.html#21">protein tyrosine kinases</a> (<a href="output.html#21">PTK</a>) in <a href="output.html#56">LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation</a> and <a href="output.html#100">TNF-alpha production</a>.
We hypothesized that inhibition of either <a href="output.html#20">PKC</a> or <a href="output.html#21">PTK</a> would decrease <a href="output.html#169">LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA</a> binding and <a href="output.html#36">TNF-alpha release in human monocytes</a>.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: <a href="output.html#16">Human monocytes</a> were stimulated with <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a> (50 ng/ml) alone or LPS (100 ng/ml) with and without a nonspecific serine/threonine <a href="output.html#8">protein kinase</a> inhibitor staurosporine (Stauro), a specific pan-<a href="output.html#20">PKC</a> inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (Bis), or an inhibitor of <a href="output.html#21">PTK</a> genistein (Gen).
<a href="output.html#39">TNF-alpha release</a> in culture supernatants was measured by an ELISA.
<a href="output.html#104">NF-kappaB DNA</a> binding was evaluated by <a href="output.html#14">electrophoretic mobility shift assay</a>.
RESULTS: LPS increased <a href="output.html#104">NF-kappaB DNA</a> binding and <a href="output.html#36">TNF-alpha release in human monocytes</a>.
Nonspecific <a href="output.html#196">protein kinase inhibition</a> inhibited <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappaB activation</a> and <a href="output.html#39">TNF-alpha release</a>, while specific <a href="output.html#20">PKC</a> inhibition with Bis had no effect on <a href="output.html#169">LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA</a> binding or <a href="output.html#39">TNF-alpha release</a>.
<a href="output.html#21">PTK</a> inhibition with Gen attenuated both <a href="output.html#169">LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA</a> binding and <a href="output.html#100">TNF-alpha production</a> in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a>.
Direct activation of <a href="output.html#20">PKC</a> with <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a> induced both <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappaB activation</a> and <a href="output.html#100">TNF-alpha production</a> by <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a>.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <a href="output.html#56">LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation</a> and <a href="output.html#36">TNF-alpha release in human monocytes</a> are independent of <a href="output.html#20">PKC</a> activity.
Furthermore, our results provide evidence that <a href="output.html#21">PTK</a> plays a role in <a href="output.html#56">LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation</a> and <a href="output.html#36">TNF-alpha release in human monocytes</a> and thus could be a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory states.

Binding characteristics of the <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptor</a> in <a href="output.html#45">peripheral blood lymphocytes</a> in multiple sclerosis.

Although the exact etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains unresolved, immune reactions are believed to be the central pathogenic mechanisms.
Endogenous and therapeutic steroid hormones affect the <a href="output.html#121">immune system</a>, and inflammatory diseases are associated with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, providing evidence of an immune-endocrine interplay.
Function tests in MS have revealed dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system in a substantial proportion of patients.
We characterized <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptor</a> (<a href="output.html#7">GR</a>) binding in <a href="output.html#45">peripheral blood lymphocytes</a> from 39 MS patients and 14 age- and sex-matched controls with respect to dissociation constant and binding capacity, using a whole-cell binding assay with [3H]dexamethasone as the ligand.
<a href="output.html#7">GR</a> binding parameters did not differ significantly between patients (Kd 8.98 +/- 1.07 nM, Bmax 183 +/- 29.8 fmol/mg) and controls (Kd 9.36 +/- 1.17 nM, Bmax 158 +/- 16 fmol/mg).
No effect of age, sex, course, duration or severity of disease, or prior <a href="output.html#290">steroid treatments</a> was detected.
<a href="output.html#7">GR</a> binding parameters were analyzed in relation to the results of the combined dexamethasone-CRH test, which reflects corticosteroid receptor function at the hypothalamus, in 30 patients and 9 controls.
While controls showed a moderate correlation between <a href="output.html#280">binding affinity</a> of the <a href="output.html#197">GR in lymphocytes</a> and regulatory function at the hypothalamic level, the patients did not.
These data suggest that the physiological relationship between binding and function of the <a href="output.html#7">glucocorticoid receptor</a> is disturbed in MS.

<a href="output.html#31">Signal transduction</a> pathways in <a href="output.html#198">normal human monocytes</a> stimulated by cytokines and mediators: comparative study with normal human neutrophils or transformed cells and the putative roles in functionality and cell biology.

<a href="output.html#13">Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor</a> (<a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>) and interleukin (IL) -3 induced <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of 92-kDa protein in <a href="output.html#198">normal human monocytes</a>.
We identified this 92-kDa protein as STAT5, but not as STATs1, 3, and 6 nor c-fes and vav protooncogene products, and demonstrated its translocation to the nucleus, enhancement of specific DNA binding capacity, and potentiation of trancriptional activity by <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>.
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and <a href="output.html#22">phorbol myristate acetate</a> (<a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>) induced <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> of 42- and 44-kDa proteins, which were identified as <a href="output.html#60">extracellular signal-regulated kinase</a> (<a href="output.html#60">ERK</a>), in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a>.
In marked contrast to neutrophils and <a href="output.html#291">MO7e cells</a>, <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a> did not induce <a href="output.html#27">tyrosine phosphorylation</a> and activation of <a href="output.html#60">ERK</a> in monocytes.
Among upstream signaling molecules of <a href="output.html#60">ERK</a>, Shc was constitutively associated with Grb2 and was not tyrosine-phosphorylated by <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a> and FMLP, and Sos1 and c-Raf-1 were not phosphorylated by <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>, IL-3, <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>, and FMLP in monocytes, whereas all these signaling molecules were affected and/or utilized by <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a> in <a href="output.html#291">MO7e cells</a>.
In contrast to neutrophils, p38 was constitutively phosphorylated and agonist-dependent phosphorylation and activation was not detected in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a>.
<a href="output.html#292">Superoxide release</a> stimulated by FMLP was inhibited partially by PD98059 or SB203580, a specific inhibitor of <a href="output.html#60">ERK</a> or p38 pathway, and was almost completely inhibited by the combination of both inhibitors, whereas <a href="output.html#22">PMA</a>-induced <a href="output.html#292">superoxide release</a> was resistant to these two inhibitors in monocytes.
PD98059 inhibited <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a>-dependent proliferation of <a href="output.html#291">MO7e cells</a>.
Present results indicate trancriptional roles of STAT5 and functional roles of <a href="output.html#60">ERK</a> and/or p38 in <a href="output.html#198">normal human monocytes</a> stimulated by physiological receptor-mediated agonists <a href="output.html#13">GM-CSF</a> and FMLP.
Possible roles of <a href="output.html#60">ERK</a> in proliferation of transformed cells were also suggested.

GATA-1 and erythropoietin cooperate to promote <a href="output.html#137">erythroid cell survival</a> by regulating bcl-xL expression.

The <a href="output.html#4">transcription factor</a> GATA-1 is essential for normal erythropoiesis.
By examining in vitro-differentiated embryonic stem cells, we showed previously that in the absence of GATA-1, committed erythroid precursors fail to complete maturation and instead undergo apoptosis.
The mechanisms by which GATA-1 controls <a href="output.html#303">cell survival</a> are unknown.
Here we report that in <a href="output.html#35">erythroid cells</a>, GATA-1 strongly induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xL, but not the related proteins bcl-2 and mcl-1.
Consistent with a role for bcl-xL in mediating GATA-1-induced <a href="output.html#137">erythroid cell survival</a>, in vitro-differentiated bcl-xL-/- embryonic stem cells fail to generate viable mature definitive <a href="output.html#35">erythroid cells</a>, a phenotype resembling that of GATA-1 gene disruption.
In addition, we show that erythropoietin, which is also required for <a href="output.html#137">erythroid cell survival</a>, cooperates with GATA-1 to stimulate bcl-xL <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> and to maintain erythroid cell viability during terminal maturation.
Together, our data show that bcl-xL is essential for normal erythroid development and suggest a regulatory hierarchy in which bcl-xL is a critical downstream effector of GATA-1 and erythropoietin-mediated signals.

Reactive oxygen intermediate-release of fibre-exposed monocytes increases inflammatory cytokine-mRNA level, <a href="output.html#21">protein tyrosine kinase</a> and <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappaB activity</a> in co-cultured <a href="output.html#138">bronchial epithelial cells</a> (BEAS-2B).

Some pulmonary diseases like bronchitis or asthma bronchiale are mediated by inflammatory mechanisms in <a href="output.html#138">bronchial epithelial cells</a>.
Alveolar macrophages are located directly in the surrounding of these cells, so that we suppose an interaction between <a href="output.html#102">epithelial cells</a> and macrophages regarding to the release of inflammatory mediators.
For measuring the contribution of macrophages to the release of inflammatory mediators by <a href="output.html#138">bronchial epithelial cells</a>, we established an in vitro model of co-cultured blood monocytes (BM) and <a href="output.html#293">BEAS-2B cells</a> in a transwell system (Costar).
BM were exposed to Chrysotile B and soot particle FR 101 in a concentration of 100 microg/10(6) cells.
After up to 90 min exposure time ELISA, <a href="output.html#14">EMSA</a> (electromobility shift assay) and RT-<a href="output.html#128">PCR</a> were used to measure <a href="output.html#71">protein tyrosine kinase activity</a>, protein activity of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> and cytokine (IL-1beta, IL-6, <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>) specific mRNA levels in <a href="output.html#293">BEAS-2B cells</a>.
We observed an increase in <a href="output.html#71">protein tyrosine kinase activity</a> (up to 1.8 +/- 0.5-fold) and <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> protein activity in <a href="output.html#293">BEAS-2B cells</a> after particle or fibre exposure of co-cultured BM.
Consecutive IL-1beta-, IL-6- and <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>-mRNA were elevated (up to 1.9 +/- 0.58-fold).
<a href="output.html#71">Protein tyrosine kinase activity</a>, <a href="output.html#6">NF-kappaB activity</a>, and the synthesis of cytokine-specific mRNA were inhibited by antioxidants.

Host defense mechanisms triggered by <a href="output.html#294">microbial lipoproteins</a> through <a href="output.html#295">toll-like receptors</a>.

Yet, for many pathogens, the molecules that induce IL-12 production by macrophages and the mechanisms by which they do so remain undefined.
Here it is shown that <a href="output.html#294">microbial lipoproteins</a> are potent stimulators of IL-12 production by human macrophages, and that induction is mediated by <a href="output.html#295">Toll-like receptors</a> (<a href="output.html#295">TLRs</a>).

Recent data show that TCR/CD3 stimulation induces activation of Stat5 in <a href="output.html#126">murine T cells</a>.
Here, we show that <a href="output.html#304">CD3 ligation</a> by mAb and <a href="output.html#235">Staphylococcal enterotoxin</a> (<a href="output.html#235">SE</a>) induce a rapid, gradually accumulating, long-lasting tyrosine, and <a href="output.html#139">serine phosphorylation of Stat3</a> (but not Stat5) in allogen-specific human CD4+ T <a href="output.html#15">cell lines</a>.
In contrast, IL-2 induces a rapid and transient tyrosine and <a href="output.html#139">serine phosphorylation of Stat3</a>.
Compared with IL-2, <a href="output.html#304">CD3 ligation</a> induces a delayed Stat3 binding to oligonucleotide probes from the <a href="output.html#28">ICAM-1</a> and <a href="output.html#94">IL-2R</a> alpha promoter.
CD3-mediated activation of Stat3 is almost completely inhibited by a Src kinase inhibitor (PP1), whereas IL-2-induced <a href="output.html#236">Stat3 activation</a> is unaffected.
In conclusion, we show that <a href="output.html#304">CD3 ligation</a> by mAb and <a href="output.html#235">SE</a> triggers a rapid, PP1-sensitive tyrosine and <a href="output.html#139">serine phosphorylation of Stat3</a> in human CD4+ T cells.
Moreover, we provide evidence that TCR/CD3 and IL-2 induce <a href="output.html#236">Stat3 activation</a> via distinct signaling pathways.

Differential effects of lipopolysaccharide and <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a> on monocytic IkappaB kinase signalsome activation and IkappaB proteolysis.

The inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and <a href="output.html#2">tumor necrosis factor</a> (<a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>) are potent activators of <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>.
This study compared the effect of these stimuli on endogenous IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalsome activation and IkappaB phosphorylation/proteolysis in <a href="output.html#140">human monocytic cells</a> and investigated the role of the signalsome proteins IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a>-inducing kinase (NIK), IKK-gamma (<a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> essential modulator), and IKK complex-associated protein.
Kinase assays showed that <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a> elicited a rapid but short-lived induction of IKK activity with a 3-fold greater effect on IKK-alpha than on IKK-beta, peaking at 5 min.
In contrast, LPS predominantly stimulated IKK-beta activity, which slowly increased, peaking at 30 min.
A second peak was observed at a later time point following <a href="output.html#212">LPS stimulation</a>, which consisted of both IKK-alpha and -beta activity.
The endogenous levels of the signalsome components were unaffected by stimulation.
Furthermore, our studies showed association of the IKK-alpha/beta heterodimer with NIK, IkappaB-alpha and -epsilon in unstimulated cells.
Exposure to LPS or <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a> led to differential patterns of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-epsilon disappearance from and reassembly with the signalsome, whereas IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, and NIK remained complex-associated.
NIK cannot phosphorylate IkappaB-alpha directly, but it appears to be a functionally important subunit, because mutated NIK inhibited stimulus-induced kappaB-dependent transcription more effectively than mutated IKK-alpha or -beta.
Overexpression of IKK complex-associated protein inhibited stimulus-mediated transcription, whereas <a href="output.html#3">NF-kappaB</a> essential modulator enhanced it.
The understanding of LPS- and <a href="output.html#1">TNF</a>-induced signaling may allow the development of specific strategies to treat sepsis-associated disease.

Gender and vascular reactivity.

<a href="output.html#32">Estrogen receptors</a> are found on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells; their expression is influenced by exposure to the hormone.
<a href="output.html#32">Estrogen receptors</a> influence non-genomic events, which are rapid in onset and genomic events, which are longer acting responses.
Estrogens affect vascular tone indirectly by modulating release of endothelium-derived vasoactive factors and directly by modulating intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells.
Estrogens indirectly affect thrombotic events and inflammation by altering platelet aggregation and leukocyte adherence and migration, respectively.
Estrogens also influence production of mitogens which, when released at sites of vascular injury, affect vascular remodeling.
Although estrogens initiate vascular responses, genomic sex may influence and/or limit expression of <a href="output.html#32">estrogen receptors</a> and therefore actions of sex steroid hormones throughout the vasculature.

Glucocorticoids induce apoptosis in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a>: potential role of <a href="output.html#112">IL-1 beta</a>.

Glucocorticoids (GC) are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents that act on a variety of immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages.
However, the exact cellular mechanisms underlying this anti-inflammatory capacity are still unknown.
In our study, we determined the <a href="output.html#238">induction of apoptosis</a> by GC in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a>.
<a href="output.html#46">Peripheral blood monocytes</a> were isolated by density centrifugation methods with a purity of >90% and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium.
<a href="output.html#237">Monocyte apoptosis</a> was determined by four independent methods, including annexin-V staining, TUNEL, DNA-laddering, and typical morphology by means of transmission electron microscopy.
<a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> and IL-1beta were measured by ELISA.
GC receptor was blocked with mifepristone.
Caspase 3 was inhibited with caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-CHO).
Stimulation with different GC at therapeutic concentrations resulted in <a href="output.html#237">monocyte apoptosis</a> in a time- and <a href="output.html#231">dose-dependent manner</a>.
Necrosis was excluded by propidium iodide staining.
Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a> were down-regulated by GC treatment.
Continuous treatment of monocytes with IL-1beta, but not with <a href="output.html#1">TNF-alpha</a>, could almost completely prevent GC-induced cell death.
The addition of mifepristone or caspase-3 inhibitor could partially abrogate GC-induced apoptosis as well as GC-induced inhibition of IL-1beta.
This is the first study to demonstrate <a href="output.html#238">induction of apoptosis</a> by GC in <a href="output.html#16">human monocytes</a>.
GC-induced <a href="output.html#237">monocyte apoptosis</a> may be partially mediated through effects on IL-1beta production.
It is conceivable that GC exert their anti-inflammatory capacity in various diseases, at least in part, by the <a href="output.html#238">induction of apoptosis</a> in monocytes.

<a href="output.html#170">Neutrophil maturation</a> and the role of <a href="output.html#12">retinoic acid</a>.

<a href="output.html#170">Neutrophil maturation</a> occurs in well defined morphological stages that correlate with the acquisition of molecular markers associated with neutrophil function.
A variety of factors are known to play a role in terminal <a href="output.html#170">neutrophil maturation</a>, including the vitamin A derivative, <a href="output.html#12">retinoic acid</a>.
<a href="output.html#12">Retinoic acid</a> can directly modulate <a href="output.html#5">gene expression</a> via binding to its nuclear receptors, which can, in turn, activate transcription of target genes.
A role for <a href="output.html#12">retinoic acid</a> during <a href="output.html#170">neutrophil maturation</a> has been suggested from a variety of sources. Here we present a review of the mechanism of <a href="output.html#30">retinoic acid receptor</a> action and the major evidence showing that normal retinoid signaling is required for <a href="output.html#170">neutrophil maturation</a>.
